Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn
    and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing
    computer programs that can access data and learn from it automatically.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
    2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
    3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error
    
    Key Concepts:
    - Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
    - Features: Input variables used to make predictions
    - Labels: The output we're trying to predict
    - Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
    - Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
    
    Common Algorithms:
    - Linear Regression: For predicting continuous values
    - Logistic Regression: For binary classification
    - Decision Trees: For both classification and regression
    - Neural Networks: For complex pattern recognition
