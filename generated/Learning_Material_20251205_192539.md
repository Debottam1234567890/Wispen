## Easy Cards (10)

### Card 1 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Machine Learning

**Back:** A type of AI where computers learn from data without being specifically told how to do everything.

**Explanation:** Machine learning allows systems to improve their performance on a task by learning from data, like recognizing pictures of cats after seeing many examples. This differs from traditional programming where every step must be explicitly coded.

## Medium Cards (12)

### Card 1 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Reinforcement Learning

**Back:** A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving positive or negative feedback (rewards) for its actions.

**Explanation:** Reinforcement learning is distinct because it doesn't rely on labeled data like supervised learning. Instead, an agent explores an environment, trying different actions and learning from the resulting rewards to develop an optimal policy.

**Tags:** Machine Learning, Agent, Reward, Policy

### Card 2 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is the term for when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on unseen data?

**Back:** Overfitting

**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model essentially memorizes the training data, including its noise and outliers. This leads to a model that is highly accurate on the data it was trained on, but fails to generalize to new, unseen data because it has learned the specific nuances of the training set rather than the underlying patterns.

**Tags:** Overfitting, Generalization, Machine Learning, Model Evaluation

---

### Card 3 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Define Decision Trees in the context of Machine Learning.

**Back:** Decision Trees are a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the data space into smaller subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure to predict outcomes.

**Explanation:** Decision Trees are versatile because they can handle both categorical (classification) and numerical (regression) data. The tree structure allows for easy interpretation of the decision-making process, making them a popular choice in many applications.

**Tags:** Decision Trees, Classification, Regression, Supervised Learning

### Card 4 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is a neural network?

**Back:** A computational algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the brain, used for complex pattern recognition and prediction.

**Explanation:** Neural networks are designed to mimic how biological neurons work, allowing them to learn intricate patterns from data. This makes them effective tools for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and forecasting.

**Tags:** Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition

### Card 5 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Define Underfitting.

**Back:** A scenario where a model is too simple to adequately capture the underlying patterns in the training data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test sets.

**Explanation:** Underfitting occurs when a model lacks the complexity to represent the relationship between the features and the target variable. A linear model attempting to fit a highly non-linear dataset is a common example, resulting in high bias and low variance.

**Tags:** Model Bias, Model Complexity, Machine Learning, Overfitting

---

### Card 6 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is the ability of a machine learning model to accurately predict outcomes on new, previously unseen data called?

**Back:** Generalization

**Explanation:** Generalization is crucial for a model's real-world applicability. A model that generalizes well can make accurate predictions on data it wasn't trained on, indicating it has learned underlying patterns rather than memorizing the training data.

**Tags:** machine learning, model performance, unseen data, prediction

---

### Card 7 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is the primary goal of regularization techniques in machine learning?

**Back:** To prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models.

**Explanation:** Regularization aims to simplify the model and improve its ability to generalize to unseen data. By penalizing large coefficients, it reduces the model's reliance on specific training examples, thus combatting overfitting. L1 and L2 are common methods.

**Tags:** Regularization, Overfitting, Machine Learning, Bias-Variance Tradeoff

### Card 8 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is the process of dividing a dataset into groups of similar data points called?

**Back:** Clustering

**Explanation:** Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to identify inherent groupings within data. The algorithm groups data points based on their similarity, where data points within the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. A common clustering algorithm is K-Means.

**Tags:** Clustering, Unsupervised Learning, Data Analysis, K-Means

### Card 9 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Dimensionality Reduction

**Back:** The process of reducing the number of features (variables) in a dataset while retaining important information. This is often done to simplify models, reduce computational cost, and prevent overfitting.

**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction aims to simplify data without losing crucial patterns. Techniques like PCA help by finding the most important axes of variation. A dataset with 100 columns could be reduced to 10, making analysis faster and potentially improving model performance.

**Tags:** Feature Extraction, Data Preprocessing, PCA, Machine Learning

### Card 10 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Environment

**Back:** The surroundings in which the agent operates.

**Explanation:** In reinforcement learning, the environment provides the agent with observations and receives actions from the agent. It also determines the reward the agent receives, shaping its behavior through interaction.

**Tags:** Reinforcement Learning, Agent, State, Interaction

---

### Card 11 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** What is Feature Engineering?

**Back:** The process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.

**Explanation:** Feature engineering is crucial because machine learning algorithms learn from data. Well-engineered features can expose underlying patterns and relationships in the data, leading to better model accuracy and efficiency. For example, converting a date into year, month, and day features might reveal seasonal trends.

### Card 12 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Deep Learning

**Back:** A subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze data and learn complex patterns.

**Explanation:** Deep learning excels at tasks like image recognition and natural language processing because the multiple layers of the neural network allow it to learn hierarchical representations of data. For example, in image recognition, early layers might detect edges, while later layers combine these edges to identify objects.

## Hard Cards (1)

### Card 1 [DEFINITION]

**Front:** Explain how the chain rule is fundamentally applied within the backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients, and why this approach is essential for training deep neural networks.

**Back:** Backpropagation uses the chain rule to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. Starting from the output layer, the gradient is calculated layer by layer, propagating backwards through the network. This allows for efficient computation of gradients across many layers, which is crucial for training deep networks where direct calculation would be computationally infeasible.

**Explanation:** The chain rule allows the gradient of a composite function (the loss function in this case) to be expressed in terms of the gradients of its constituent functions (the layers of the network). This iterative, layer-by-layer calculation avoids redundant computations and provides an efficient way to update weights based on their contribution to the overall error, especially in deep networks.
