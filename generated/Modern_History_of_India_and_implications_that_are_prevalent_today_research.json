It highlights key movements, formations, and changes that shaped the nation during this transformative period. Understanding these events is crucial for students preparing for exams like the UPSC.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   The Revolt of 1857 marked the beginning of India\u2019s struggle for independence.\n*   The Indian National Congress was formed in 1885, becoming a central figure in the fight for freedom.\n*   The Swadeshi Movement emerged in response to the Partition of Bengal in 1905, promoting self-reliance.\n*   World War II significantly influenced India\u2019s independence movement, leading to increased demands for freedom.\n*   The Quit India Movement of 1942 was a pivotal moment that united Indians against British rule.\n\nThe Revolt of 1857: The First War of Indian Independence\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Revolt of 1857, often called the [First War of Independence](https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Rebellion-of-1857), was a major uprising against British rule in India. It began on May 10, 1857, when Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, revolted against their British officers. **This revolt marked a significant turning point in Indian history.**\n\n### Causes of the Revolt\n\n*   **Cultural Insensitivity**: The introduction of the Enfield rifle, rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat, angered Hindu and Muslim soldiers.\n*   **Economic Hardships**: British policies led to heavy taxation and suffering among Indian farmers.\n*   **Political Discontent**: The Doctrine of Lapse and other policies angered local rulers and nobility.\n\n### Major Events and Leaders\n\n*   **Key Figures**: Leaders like Rani Lakshmibai, Bahadur Shah Zafar, and Nana Sahib played crucial roles.\n*   **Major Battles**: The revolt spread to cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow, where fierce battles took place.\n*   **British Response**: The British responded with brutal force, leading to widespread destruction.\n\n### Consequences of the Revolt\n\n*   **End of the East India Company**: The British government took direct control of India after suppressing the revolt.\n*   **Rise of Nationalism**: The revolt ignited a sense of nationalism among Indians, laying the groundwork for future movements.\n*   **Social Changes**: The revolt highlighted the need for reforms in British policies and administration.\n\n> The Revolt of 1857 was not just a military uprising; it was a significant step towards the eventual independence of India from British rule.\n\nThis revolt is remembered as a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression and is often seen as the beginning of the struggle for Indian independence.\n\nFormation of the Indian National Congress in 1885\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n[The Indian National Congress](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indian-National-Congress) (INC) was established in **1885**, marking a significant step in the organized political opposition to British rule in India. This formation was driven by a desire for greater representation and self-governance within the British Empire.\n\n### Objectives and Founders\n\nThe primary goal of the INC was to achieve **Dominion Status** for India, which would allow for a considerable degree of self-governance while still being part of the British Commonwealth. Key founders included:\n\n*   **Dadabhai Naoroji**: Known as the \u201cGrand Old Man of India,\u201d he was instrumental in articulating the economic grievances of Indians.\n*   **Gopal Krishna Gokhale**: A respected leader who emphasized education and moral values.\n*   **Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee**: The first president of the INC.\n\n### Early Sessions and Activities\n\nIn its early years, the INC focused on:\n\n*   Presenting demands for political reforms through petitions to British authorities.\n*   Advocating for civil rights and local self-government.\n*   Promoting Western education as a means for social and political progress.\n\n### Impact on Indian Nationalism\n\nThe formation of the INC laid the groundwork for future movements against British rule. It united various social groups and fostered a sense of national identity among Indians. The INC\u2019s early efforts were crucial in raising awareness about the need for political change and self-determination in India.\n\n> The Indian National Congress was a pivotal force in shaping the future of India\u2019s independence movement, bringing together diverse voices in the struggle against colonial rule.\n\nPartition of Bengal in 1905 and the Swadeshi Movement\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Reasons for Partition\n\nThe **Partition of Bengal** in 1905 was primarily driven by the British policy of divide and rule. The British aimed to weaken the growing nationalist movement by dividing Bengal into two parts: a Muslim-majority Eastern Bengal and a Hindu-majority West Bengal. This division was seen as an attempt to disrupt the unity among Indians and to control the rising tide of nationalism.\n\n### Swadeshi Movement: Boycott and Self-Reliance\n\nIn response to the partition, the Swadeshi Movement emerged, encouraging Indians to boycott British goods and promote local products. This movement aimed to foster self-reliance and economic independence. Key actions included:\n\n*   **Boycotting British goods**: People were urged to stop using British products and instead support Indian-made items.\n*   **Reviving local industries**: The movement led to the establishment of local textile mills and soap factories, boosting the Indian economy.\n*   **Public demonstrations**: Mass protests and rallies were organized to raise awareness and show unity against British rule.\n\n### Reversal of Partition\n\nThe Swadeshi Movement gained momentum, leading to widespread protests. The British government faced increasing pressure, and by 1911, the partition was reversed. This reversal was a significant victory for the Indian nationalists and showcased the power of collective action.\n\n> The Swadeshi Movement was a turning point in Indian history, demonstrating that united efforts could challenge British authority and inspire a sense of national pride among Indians.\n\nOverall, the events surrounding the **Partition of Bengal** and the subsequent **Swadeshi Movement** played a crucial role in shaping the Indian independence struggle, highlighting the importance of unity and self-reliance in the face of colonial oppression.\n\nThe Rise of the Muslim League in 1906\n-------------------------------------\n\n### Formation and Objectives\n\nThe [All India Muslim League](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Muslim-League) was established on December 30, 1906, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Its main goal was to represent the political rights of Indian Muslims and to ensure their distinct identity was recognized by the British government. The League aimed to:\n\n*   Protect the political rights of Muslims.\n*   Prevent the development of intolerance towards other communities.\n*   Advocate for separate electorates for Muslims.\n\n### Key Leaders and Their Roles\n\nProminent figures in the formation of the Muslim League included:\n\n*   Agha Khan\n*   Khwaja Salimullah\n*   Syed Amir Ali\n*   Syed Nabiullah\n*   Mustafa Chowdhury\n\nThese leaders played crucial roles in shaping the League\u2019s objectives and strategies.\n\n### Impact on Indian Politics\n\nThe establishment of the Muslim League had significant implications for Indian politics. It reinforced the idea that Hindus and Muslims belonged to separate cultures, which led to:\n\n*   Increased communal tensions.\n*   A shift in political dynamics, as the League began to advocate for Muslim interests.\n*   The eventual demand for a separate nation for Muslims, which culminated in the creation of Pakistan in 1947.\n\n> The formation of the Muslim League marked a pivotal moment in Indian history, as it laid the groundwork for future political developments and communal divisions.\n\nThe Home Rule Movement (1916-1918)\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Home Rule Movement was a significant political campaign in India aimed at achieving self-governance during the British colonial rule. **It marked a crucial milestone in the liberation struggle.** This movement was primarily led by two prominent leaders: Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant.\n\n### Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak\n\n*   Bal Gangadhar Tilak initiated the movement in April 1916 at Belgaum.\n*   Annie Besant joined the movement later in September 1916 in Madras.\n*   Both leaders aimed to unite Indians in their quest for self-rule.\n\n### Objectives and Strategies\n\nThe main goals of the Home Rule Movement included:\n\n1.   Achieving self-governance without British interference.\n2.   Raising political awareness among Indians.\n3.   Assembling a larger political representation to oppose British rule.\n\n### Impact on Indian Independence Movement\n\nThe movement had several important outcomes:\n\n*   It demonstrated the strength of Indian unity against colonial rule.\n*   It led to the **Montague Declaration of 1917**, which promised greater Indian representation in governance.\n*   The movement helped to unify various factions within the Indian National Congress, bridging the gap between moderates and extremists.\n\n> The Home Rule Movement was not just a political campaign; it was a powerful expression of the Indian people\u2019s desire for freedom and self-determination.\n\nOverall, the Home Rule Movement played a vital role in shaping the future of India\u2019s struggle for independence, laying the groundwork for future movements and actions against British rule.\n\nThe Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe Non-Cooperation Movement was a significant campaign in India\u2019s struggle for independence. It was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920 to oppose British rule and promote national unity. The movement aimed to encourage Indians to withdraw from British institutions and practices. **The movement marked a turning point in Indian nationalism, fostering a sense of political awareness among the masses.**\n\n### Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movement \u2013 1920\n\n*   The Khilafat Movement began in 1919, as Indian Muslims protested against the British treatment of the Caliph in Turkey.\n*   The Indian National Congress (INC) joined forces with the Khilafat Committee to launch the Non-Cooperation Movement on September 5, 1920.\n*   Gandhi urged people to boycott British goods, schools, and offices, promoting the use of Swadeshi (local products).\n\n### Objectives and Strategies\n\n1.   **Boycott British goods**: Indians were encouraged to stop using British products and support local industries.\n2.   **Non-violent protests**: The movement emphasized peaceful resistance against British authority.\n3.   **Promotion of self-reliance**: Gandhi encouraged the spinning of Khadi (handspun cloth) as a symbol of self-sufficiency.\n\n### Impact and Withdrawal\n\n*   The movement saw massive participation from various sections of society, raising national consciousness among Indians.\n*   However, the movement was called off in February 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident, where violence erupted, leading to the death of 22 policemen.\n*   Gandhi believed that violence contradicted the principles of non-violence and decided to end the movement to maintain its integrity.\n\n> The Non-Cooperation Movement was a crucial step in uniting Indians against British rule, laying the groundwork for future movements toward independence.\n\nThe Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934)\n-------------------------------------------\n\n### Salt March and Its Significance\n\nThe Civil Disobedience Movement was a major campaign led by [**Mahatma Gandhi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) in 1930. It aimed to challenge British laws through nonviolent resistance. One of the most famous events was the [**Salt March**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March), which started on **March 12, 1930**. Gandhi and **78 supporters** marched from **Ahmedabad** to the **Dandi coast**, reaching their destination on **April 5, 1930**. This march was a protest against the British salt tax, which was seen as unfair and oppressive.\n\n### Major Events and Participation\n\nDuring the movement, many Indians joined in various forms of protest. Here are some key points:\n\n*   Over 60,000 people were arrested, including Gandhi himself.\n*   The movement encouraged people to produce their own salt, breaking the law.\n*   It raised awareness about the struggle for independence across the country.\n\n### Impact and Withdrawal\n\nThe Civil Disobedience Movement had a significant impact on Indian society and politics. It led to:\n\n*   Increased national awareness and unity among Indians.\n*   The **Gandhi-Irwin Pact** in 1931, which allowed Indians to produce salt for household use.\n*   A shift in British policies due to the pressure from the movement.\n\n> The Civil Disobedience Movement marked a turning point in the Indian struggle for independence, showcasing the power of nonviolent resistance against colonial rule.\n\nThe Quit India Movement of 1942\n-------------------------------\n\nThe [**Quit India Movement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_Movement#:~:text=The%20Quit%20India%20Movement%20was,to%20British%20rule%20in%20India.) was a significant event in India\u2019s struggle for independence. It was launched by **Mahatma Gandhi** on August 8, 1942, demanding an end to British rule in India. This movement was a response to the failure of the Cripps Mission, which aimed to negotiate India\u2019s future during World War II but did not meet Indian expectations.\n\n### Call for Immediate Independence\n\n*   The Indian National Congress (INC) called for a mass civil disobedience movement.\n*   The Congress Working Committee accepted the idea of independence at a meeting in Wardha on July 14, 1942.\n*   Gandhi\u2019s slogan was \u201cDo or Die,\u201d urging people to fight for freedom.\n\n### Mass Participation and Repression\n\n*   The movement saw widespread participation from various sections of society, including students, workers, and peasants.\n*   The British government responded with severe repression, declaring the INC an unlawful organization and arresting many leaders.\n*   Despite the crackdown, the movement intensified, showcasing the people\u2019s determination for freedom.\n\n### Impact on India\u2019s Independence\n\n*   The Quit India Movement marked a turning point in the Indian independence struggle.\n*   It placed the demand for complete independence at the forefront of the national agenda.\n*   The movement\u2019s legacy continued to inspire future generations in their fight against colonial rule.\n\n> The Quit India Movement was a mass civil disobedience movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, demanding an end to British rule in India.\n\nIn summary, the Quit India Movement was a crucial step towards India\u2019s independence, highlighting the unity and resolve of the Indian people against colonial oppression.\n\nThe Partition of India in 1947\n------------------------------\n\nThe [Partition of India](https://www.britannica.com/event/Partition-of-India) in 1947 was a significant event that led to the creation of two independent nations: India and Pakistan. This division was primarily based on religious lines, with India being predominantly Hindu and Pakistan being predominantly Muslim. **The partition was set to take effect on August 15, 1947.**\n\n### Reasons for Partition\n\n*   **Religious Differences**: The growing divide between Hindus and Muslims.\n*   **Political Tensions**: The failure of negotiations between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League.\n*   **British Policies**: The British colonial strategy of \u201cdivide and rule\u201d exacerbated communal tensions.\n\n### Major Events Leading to Partition\n\n1.   **Cabinet Mission Plan (1946)**: Attempted to resolve the deadlock between political parties but failed.\n2.   **Direct Action Day (August 16, 1946)**: A day of violence in Calcutta that marked the beginning of widespread communal riots.\n3.   **Indian Independence Act (July 1947)**: Passed by the British Parliament, it outlined the process for partition.\n\n### Consequences and Impact on India and Pakistan\n\n*   **Mass Migration**: Millions of people were forced to move across borders, leading to one of the largest migrations in history.\n*   **Communal Violence**: Widespread violence erupted, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.\n*   **Long-term Tensions**: The partition laid the groundwork for ongoing conflicts between India and Pakistan, particularly over the Kashmir region.\n\n> The partition not only changed the political landscape of the subcontinent but also had lasting effects on the social fabric of both nations.\n\nIn summary, the Partition of India was a complex event driven by various factors, leading to significant changes in the region\u2019s demographics and politics. It remains a pivotal moment in modern Indian history, with repercussions that are still felt today.\n\nThe Role of Women in the Indian Independence Movement\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWomen played a crucial part in the Indian independence movement, stepping out of their traditional roles to fight for freedom. **Their participation was not just significant; it was transformative.** Women like Sarojini Naidu, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, and Annie Besant emerged as leaders, inspiring many others to join the struggle.\n\n### Key Female Leaders\n\n*   **Sarojini Naidu**: Known as the \u201cNightingale of India,\u201d she was a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress and played a vital role in the Civil Disobedience Movement.\n*   **Annie Besant**: A British social reformer who became a key figure in the Home Rule Movement, advocating for self-governance.\n*   **Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay**: She was instrumental in promoting the Swadeshi Movement and women\u2019s rights.\n\n### Women\u2019s Participation in Major Movements\n\nWomen participated in various movements, including:\n\n1.   **Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)**: Many women joined protests and boycotts against British goods.\n2.   **Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934)**: Women took part in the Salt March and other acts of defiance.\n3.   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: Women played a significant role in organizing protests and rallies, often facing arrest and violence.\n\n### Impact on Post-Independence India\n\nThe involvement of women in the freedom struggle empowered them and brought them out of domestic confinement into public life, professions, and governance roles. This shift laid the groundwork for future generations of women to continue advocating for their rights and equality in independent India.\n\n> The struggle for independence was not just a fight against colonial rule; it was also a fight for women\u2019s rights and empowerment in society.\n\nThe Impact of World War II on India\u2019s Independence Struggle\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWorld War II had a significant effect on India\u2019s fight for independence. **The war intensified the demand for freedom** among Indians, as many felt that the British were too preoccupied with the war to maintain control over India.\n\n### India\u2019s Involvement in the War\n\n*   India contributed a large number of troops to the British war effort.\n*   The war caused economic strain, leading to shortages and inflation.\n*   Many Indians began to question why they should fight for a country that did not grant them freedom.\n\n### Economic and Social Impact\n\n*   The war led to increased unemployment and poverty in India.\n*   Food shortages resulted in the Bengal Famine of 1943, which caused millions of deaths.\n*   The economic hardships fueled anger against British rule and increased support for independence movements.\n\n### Post-War Political Developments\n\n*   After the war, the British government faced pressure to address Indian demands for self-rule.\n*   The Quit India Movement in 1942 was a direct response to the British refusal to grant immediate independence.\n*   The war weakened British authority, making it harder for them to suppress the growing independence movement.\n\n> The impact of World War II on India was profound, as it not only fueled the desire for independence but also exposed the weaknesses of British rule.\n\nIn summary, World War II was a turning point in India\u2019s struggle for independence, leading to increased political activism and ultimately paving the way for freedom in 1947. The [impact of World War II on India](https://prepp.in/news/e-492-impact-of-world-war-ii-on-india-modern-india-history-notes) was crucial in shaping the future of the nation.\n\nThe Indian National Army and Subhas Chandra Bose\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Formation and Objectives\n\nThe **Indian National Army (INA)** was formed in 1942 by [Subhas Chandra Bose](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Subhas-Chandra-Bose). Its main goal was to fight against British rule in India. Bose believed that armed struggle was necessary to achieve freedom for India. The INA aimed to unite Indians and encourage them to join the fight for independence.\n\n### Major Campaigns and Battles\n\nThe INA participated in several key campaigns during World War II. Some of the notable ones include:\n\n1.   **Battle of Imphal**: A significant battle where the INA aimed to capture Imphal in Manipur.\n2.   **Battle of Kohima**: This battle was crucial for the INA\u2019s efforts to advance into India.\n3.   **Burma Campaign**: The INA fought alongside Japanese forces in Burma, trying to push back British troops.\n\n### Impact on Indian Independence\n\nThe efforts of the INA and Bose had a profound impact on the Indian independence movement.

India\n==========================\n\n![Image 5: Schoolkids in Rajasthan, India. (asbjorn.hansen/flickr)](https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1200w/public/S/schoolkids.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\nIn this reading, the author introduces five themes that are central to understanding modern India. As with any set of generalizations, there are exceptions, and not all authorities will agree with the author. As you study more about India you will be better able to come back to Buultjen's five ideas and decide whether you agree with him.\n\nFive important features which will perhaps give us some aid in understanding modern India:\n\n1.    Its diversity\n2.   The depth of culture\n3.   A land of minorities\n4.   Its future depends on the interaction between two worlds:\n5.   In the cities and rural India, poverty, spirituality and modernity mix and coexist\n\nMany people in the Western world think of India as an inert and distant [grouping] of people and poverty, a combination of the exotic and tragic. This misperception, popularized through years of media stereotyping, conceals reality.\n\nIn fact, India is a vibrant society with an increasingly vigorous internal dynamic and an increasing influence, directly and indirectly, in the world. Its significance lies not only in its size\u2014some 930 million Indians are 15 percent of the planetary population\u2014but also in the questions raised by the path India has chosen in domestic and foreign policy. This nation is the largest functioning democracy, with regular and freely contested elections. Thus, it is the test of whether democracy is a suitable system of govemment for large numbers of relatively poor people_in a world where democracy, as we understand it, is a much-endangered political species, especially in Third World countries.\n\nModern India is also a test of two middle-ground philosophies. As an early proponent of non-alignment in international politics, India has attempted to establish a [middle] position between Western and [communist] oriented states. Over the years, its leadership in carving out a Third World posture demonstrated that there is a viable route for nations who did not want to take sides in Cold War politics, an approach which many other nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East have followed and hope to sustain.\n\nIndia's economic policies have also broken new ground. They were the first large-scale test of the modern mixed economy: central government planning with a combination of both private and public ownership of economic enterprises. It is perhaps still too early to evaluate the results. On the one hand, poverty remains [widespread] and unemployment is high. On the other, Indian agriculture has performed much better than either Soviet or Chinese agriculture. (India now feeds her population and has imported hardly any grain in the past four years.) Also, India now ranks as the ninth largest industrial economy in the world. A further significance of India today comes from the geopolitics of South Asia. Bordering the Indian Ocean into which the Persian Gulf flows, it is a key location in an era of oil logistics. Add the proximity of Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China, and India's situation becomes critical to the tensions and interactions of current global politics. From this perspective alone, apart from the many human, cultural and other reasons, it behooves thoughtful people around the world to make efforts to understand this vast and vital nation.\n\nIt is possible to say almost anything about India and have it apply to some part of that subcontinent. India is a land of [poverty] and, in some ways, of plenty. It is a nation both powerful and weak, ancient and modern, climatically dramatic in its contrasts. The very term \"India\" implies a unity which exists more as a tentative political form than as a human and socio-cultural reality. From the intertwining of its complex history with contemporary society, one can distill five important features which will perhaps give us some aids in understanding modern India.\n\nThe first feature to remember when thinking of India is its diversity. It is a country in which there are 15 official languages, over 300 minor languages and some 3,000 dialects. Twenty-four languages have more than one million speakers each. The largest spoken language is Hindi, but this is the mother tongue of only about 40 percent of the population. Often Indians cannot understand each other and frequently use English as a link or administrative language. But language is not the only diversity. There are four principal social groupings, what we sometimes call castes, and several thousand sub-categories of the castes. Although predominantly Hindu, all the world's major religions are represented in India. Ethnic differences also [abound]. This mosaic is culturally extraordinary. It is a source of divisiveness in a nation where particular loyalties have a deep meaning, both spiritually and physically. Given this diversity, it is remarkable that India has remained and grown, and continues to grow, as one nation.\n\nA second feature is the depth of culture, which contrasts with the newness of the nation in its present form. There has been over 4,000 years of philosophical and cultural development in India, going back to early Aryan civilization. Since then, Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, Sikh and other influences have left deep imprints on society. Every Indian, even the poorest illiterate, can tell stories of myth and history, a consciousness of a great civilizational heritage which is unusually widespread. Yet, there was no India as we know it until the achievement of independence in 1947. Before that there were various fragmented (some very large) territories. Many of these were absorbed into the British Indian Empire which mixed direct British rule with supervision of many areas ruled by traditional princes and local kings or maharajas. The modern state of India is only 34 years old and its development must be understood in the context of trying to impose a national framework on old cultural patterns. The consciousness of the great past and the newness of the present sometimes produces an abrasive reaction.\n\nThe third feature is that India is a land of minorities. About 80 percent of the population are Hindus. But Hinduism is an amalgam of pluralistic beliefs and forms, often containing conflicting elements. An additional 12 percent are Muslims, deeply aware of their Islamic faith. Hindu, Urdu, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telegu, Punjabi and other languages create minorities of their own. Tribal and neo-aboriginal peoples number almost 40 million. No contestant for political office can be successful without an awareness of these constituencies. And this, in turn, conditions both domestic and foreign policy.\n\nA fourth feature of modern India is that, broadly speaking, its future depends on the interaction between two worlds: the cities of India, where 20 percent of the population live, and rural India, where about 600,000 villages contain the rest of the population. Urban India is the India of modern industry, national politics and foreign policy, government planning, the national media, the major universities, business, the armed forces, science and technology. Its best products are frequently as good as the best in the world, its orientation is cosmopolitan. Rural India is the India of age-old patterns where tradition is the principal dynamic of society, where outsiders come and go but life continues, often without much change. When the two Indias mesh effectively, India is a success, as in the expansion of education, the reduction of illiteracy, the extension of the average lifespan, the introduction of some basic health care, the sustenance of a democratic political system. When they do not connect effectively, India is in trouble, as with population control and unemployment. For the nation to realize its considerable potential, the linkage between those two Indias has to be expanded and strengthened.\n\nThe fifth and final feature we must remember is that poverty, spirituality and modernity mix and coexist in India, without the paradoxical implications which a Western perspective suggests. It is the essence of Indian spirituality which enables even the most deprived to endure poverty and it is modernity which provides the prospect of improvement.\n\nIt is this spirit, a composite of many small individual visions and inspirations, which characterizes modern India and offers the best hope for the nation and its people.\n\nAuthor: Ralph Buultjens.\n\n### Additional Background Reading on Asia\n\n*   [![Image 6: selective focus gold buddha sitting statue on the wall, Fo Guang Shan Chu Un Temple, Cebu City, Philippines](https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/400x286/public/2023-06/jopeel-quimpo-qP4A-5EloaM-unsplash.jpg?h=2e8be435)](https://asiasociety.org/education/religion-philippines)   #### [Religion in the Philippines](https://asiasociety.org/education/religion-philippines) The Philippines boasts to be the only Christian nation in Asia.

Some of the key events include:\n\n1.   **British Colonial Rule (1858\u20131947)**: \n    *   The British East India Company\u2019s rule ended in 1858, when India came under direct British control after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n    *   This period was marked by economic exploitation, social reforms, and significant cultural exchanges.\n\n2.   **Indian National Congress Formation (1885)**: \n    *   The Indian National Congress (INC) was formed with the goal of obtaining greater representation for Indians in British governance.\n    *   Over time, it became the principal political party advocating for Indian independence.\n\n3.   **Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919)**: \n    *   British troops, under General Dyer, opened fire on a peaceful gathering in Amritsar, killing hundreds of unarmed Indians.\n    *   This event galvanized Indian resistance against British rule and played a pivotal role in the Indian independence movement.\n\n4.   **Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)**: \n    *   Led by Mahatma Gandhi, this movement called for non-violent resistance to British rule, including boycotting British goods, schools, and services.\n\n5.   **Salt March (1930)**: \n    *   Gandhi led a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt production, an iconic event in India\u2019s independence struggle.\n\n6.   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: \n    *   The INC, under Gandhi\u2019s leadership, launched the Quit India Movement, demanding an end to British rule. The movement was met with mass arrests and repression, but it increased the pressure on the British government.\n\n7.   **Partition and Independence (1947)**: \n    *   India gained independence from Britain on August 15, 1947, but was partitioned into two separate nations: India and Pakistan.\n    *   The partition led to widespread violence, mass migrations, and the displacement of millions.\n\n8.   **Constitution of India (1950)**: \n    *   India adopted its Constitution on January 26, 1950, establishing it as a republic. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was the principal architect of the Constitution.\n\n9.   **Indo-Pakistani War (1965)**: \n    *   Tensions between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region led to a full-scale war, which ended in a ceasefire and the subsequent Tashkent Agreement.\n\n10.   **Emergency (1975\u20131977)**: \n    *   Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency, suspending civil liberties and cracking down on political opposition. It was a controversial period in India\u2019s democracy.\n\n11.   **Economic Liberalization (1991)**: \n    *   In response to a balance of payments crisis, India began a series of economic reforms, including the liberalization of markets, devaluation of the rupee, and opening up to foreign investment.\n    *   This marked a significant shift toward a more market-oriented economy.\n\n12.   **Kargil War (1999)**: \n    *   A conflict between India and Pakistan in the Kargil region of Kashmir, the Kargil War was fought after Pakistan infiltrated Indian territory. The war ended with India reclaiming the territory.\n\n13.   **India\u2019s Nuclear Tests (1974 & 1998)**: \n    *   India conducted its first nuclear test, \u201cSmiling Buddha,\u201d in 1974, and further tests in 1998 under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which led to global concern and sanction.\n\n14.   **Rise of Digital India (2000s\u2013present)**: \n    *   India has rapidly expanded its digital infrastructure, with major initiatives like the Digital India campaign, which aims to increase online connectivity and access to government services.\n\n15.   **Abrogation of Article 370 (2019)**: \n    *   The Indian government revoked Article 370 of the Constitution, which granted special autonomy to the region of Jammu and Kashmir. This was a controversial move that escalated tensions with Pakistan and had widespread domestic implications.\n\nThese events, among many others, have had a profound impact on India\u2019s evolution as a modern nation-state.\n\nImage Source:

Many contemporary policies are often seen as immediate responses to current challenges, yet they are deeply rooted in historical frameworks that shape their purpose and design. In this paper, I explore how classical governance models influence modern Indian public policies and examine how this historical continuity impacts their effectiveness and relevance today. By analyzing five key areas\u2014Incrementalism, Ayushman Bharat, Panchayati Raj, Atmanirbhar Bharat, and Reservation policy, I aim to uncover the rich interplay between our past and present. Ultimately, this research advocates for a deeper appreciation of historical context in policy-making, as it can enhance our understanding and response to the evolving needs of Indian society. INTRODUCTION: In the face of rapid changes, a spectre continues to haunt us and living in a moment of accelerating crisis we\u2019re forced to confront numerous challenges every single day. Yet amidst these conditions, the public office of long term that we can hold accountable, is the government, who then with its tool of policy-making, attempts to respond to these epochal changes. Upon delving into the dynamics of policy-making we find that history and the lessons it provides have long played a pivotal role in the construction of social, economic, and political policies as well as structuring modern-day administration. Foundations of governance, banking, legal systems, diplomacies, and public policies in India are often built on experiences from the past and it is through these experiences that we are provided with valuable lessons, reflecting on both failures and successes that help us navigate through contemporary challenges. Guided by Harry S. Truman's observation that \u2018the only new thing in this world is the history you don't know\u2019 this paper aims to theorize how collective social memory of the past shapes our present. The primary focus is on the role of classic administrative philosophies in formulating policies of today and emphasizing on the cyclical nature of the policy-making process where old solutions are adapted to cater to modern problems. It explores multiple case studies and nuances to showcase a) instances of incrementalism and b) evidence of how historical events influence our current public policies. 1. WHAT IS INCREMENTALISM? Incrementalism is a theory that views policy-making as a process of small, gradual changes rather than large, sweeping reforms. This concept is essential in understanding how contemporary Indian public policies are formulated by building on historical precedents. By examining the roots of incrementalism, International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 2 this section will explore how historical policy frameworks continue to shape modern governance practices in India. While strategizing purposes of the government, policy-makers assimilate and act upon multiple strands of information such as historical context, societal conditions, economic trends, and public sentiments to ensure that the policies introduced are relevant and effective within the specific societal framework. However, a critical question that remains in the process is that what truly drives a change in public policy- A radical innovation or graduation evolution? In the mid 20th century when the political environment increasingly came to be shaped by competing ideologies, Charles E. Lindblom, an American political scientist, emerged as a critical voice in the field of policy analysis. The period was dominated by pursuit of ideals which according to him were abstract, like that of drawing in radical changes. He noted the complexity of real-world problems and realised that these ambitious ideals are difficult to translate into effective policies. Therefore, in response to this, incrementalism was introduced in the 1950s. This theory, shaped by the realities of time, promotes the strategy to build upon past policies and is regarded by Lindblom as a rational decision-making ideal. Its framework incorporates the concept of political expediency where matters for discussion among organizational decision-makers consist primarily of modifications to the existing programs rather than of solutions to problems involving significant change. It recognizes that decision-making is shaped by limited time, information, and the need to minimize risk for decision-makers and organizations. Incremental policy-making also values feedback and continuous mutual adjustment among decision-makers. However this theory is criticised by another school of thought, which strongly supports the radical or comprehensive change theory. Yekrezkal Dror, a professor of Political Science and Public Administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has made some trenchant criticisms of Lindblom. Dror, unable to accept the strategy, strongly argues that incrementalism is not fit for developing countries as it discourages innovation. Instead, it encourages inertia, and continuation of the status quo and believes that it constitutes a barrier in improving the policy-making process. According to him, developing countries in order to achieve acceptably large improvements in policy results cannot do with marginal changes as they are simply not sufficient. So the question under observation that remains is whether gradual incremental change is only a form of adaptation that leaves intact what ought to be changed in the society or whether it is a practical strategy for developing countries, where deficiencies like cultural and value-based differences result in lower rankings in rationality and secularisation. In answer to this, we come to realise that the approval of incrementalism is qualified by the proviso that gradualism should not become so gradual so as to be self-defeating. Cultural settings and values of different societies, if neglected in the process of policy-making, may result in unpredictable consequences. When policies are not made realistically considering the context of cultural history, the chances of successful implementation are even smaller. This pattern can be categorized as \u201cformalism\u201d where the gap between what is supposed to happen and what actually happens often increases. Such policies are therefore innovative only in a declaratory way. As one scholar succinctly describes and I quote: \u201cOnce the novel effect of the innovation passes, things somehow settle down again at their own level. The new and shining data-processing equipment does not produce the data as expected, the new procedures for processing forms of application for credit situation; the new organisations become curiously similar in their operation to the organisations they were supposed to replace\u201d Additionally most of the developing democracies of the world today have such societal conditions that International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 3 many cultural identities become resistant to large sudden changes. In this scenario, the incremental strategy turns out to be the most appropriate. Therefore, despite the unfavourable conditions mentioned by Dror, most of the developing countries reject radical changes and appear to use the methods of incrementalism and rational-deductive approach for their policy making. In fact on closer examination we find that even Indian public policies follow this trend where in place of radical shifts, policies tend to evolve, through small adjustments and build upon previous frameworks. This step-by-step evolution underscores the continuity of administrative and policy patterns of the past and their application in the present. So the sections that follow serve as case studies to illustrate how historical blueprints continue to shape contemporary public policies. The below mentioned examples demonstrate how the ideas and frameworks from the past are merely not just relics but serve a purpose as they actively inform and influence the policy-making of present times. By examining these connections, we can better understand the enduring impact of history on current governance practices. 2. AYUSHMAN BHARAT: A RESURGENCE OF INDIA\u2019S HISTORICAL WELFARE POLICIES India\u2019s welfare policies, exemplified by Ayushman Bharat, stem from a long-standing tradition of societal care and responsibility that dates back to ancient times. In eras like the Vedic period and the Mauryan dynasty, the concept of state responsibility for the well-being of its citizens was paramount, with rulers enacting policies to support the health and security of the people. These early systems emphasized the role of the state as a guardian of public welfare, creating an enduring ethos of care that has shaped modern India\u2019s approach to policy-making. Ayushman Bharat, launched to provide healthcare to economically vulnerable populations, exemplifies how this historical commitment to welfare has been adapted to address contemporary challenges. This program is more than just financial assistance; it represents the government\u2019s role as both protector and enabler of equitable growth, aligning with India's pre-colonial values. By building on these foundational ideals, India\u2019s welfare policies work to mitigate inequalities, striving to create an inclusive society that acknowledges past injustices while fostering a future based on mutual support and compassion. 2.1 Vedic Foundations of State-Sponsored Healthcare and Equity In ancient medical system of India, treatments date back to the Vedic period of about 2nd millennium B.C., With the literature Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita which established a broad framework of healthcare system in India, these texts are not only significant for the top medical knowledge of the time like usage of herbs and surgery but also for the special focus on the healthcare as the community service. Especially, they pay attention to the government\u2019s obligation in the campaign of public health, and describe the moral duties of physicians (bhishaka) to patients (rogi). The profession of physicians was supposed to deliver services to everyone, independent of rank or wealth, which set the basis for general medical equity. Charaka, the ancient Ayurvedic physician also laid much emphasis on what should be the behaviour of physicians, where they should be compassionate, friendly and free from any biases like colour, origin, financial status etc. It also underlined the value of profound knowledge of human behaviour as well as medical science. And Sushruta Samhita, which is even though majorly dominated by sections on surgery, also mentions public hospitals and charitable hospices supported by the rulers and rich people for rendering medical help International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 4 to the indigent population. Hence evidently ancient principles continue to echo in the modern day public policies especially welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat. Implemented to extend insurance to universal healthcare access for the financially unstable population, Ayushman Bharat is in harmony with these Vedic texts\u2019 underlying concepts of love and appropriate care for the forgotten people. The scheme works under the policy that some private configured hospitals provide free service which has its ethical base as ancient India saw healthcare not as a service to the privileged but as a public right,Unbiased towards any social or economic status. The historical precedence of state-sponsored welfare, seen in early medical and social programs, continues to inform India's modern welfare schemes. Ayushman Bharat embodies this long-standing tradition, reaffirming the idea that current policies are deeply influenced by India's historical approach to public welfare. These modern initiatives are not novel but extensions of the past, reflecting the continuity of care for vulnerable populations. 2.2 Ashoka\u2019s Dhamma and Mauryan Initiatives for Public Health The Mauryan Empire, particularly under Emperor Ashoka, set a high standard for governance, focusing on public welfare, healthcare, and moral responsibility. This section delves into Ashoka\u2019s Dhamma and other welfare policies, highlighting how these early systems laid the foundation for modern Indian governance models, especially in healthcare and social services. The Mauryan Empire established by Chandragupta Maurya in 321 BCE became renowned for its strongest administrative system and commitment to public welfare, particularly in the realm of healthcare. From Chandragupta\u2019s visionary governance to Ashoka\u2019s transformative Dhamma, the Mauryan rulers set enduring principles of compassionate governance that resonate even today, influencing modern policies such as Ayushman Bharat. Ashoka\u2019s Dhamma, the message of morality and ethics of behaviour that went beyond religions, paved the way for starting basic governance concepts based on compassion, non-violence and well-being of mortals. This philosophy which came after the disastrous Kalinga (present-day Odisha) war, can be said to be in consonant with such modern public policies as welfare and cosmopolitanism. Ashoka embraced new policies after he witnessed a lot of suffering which inspired him to change the policies he adopted in a bid to avoid suffering of helpless people in the Indian society, which is a lesson that is still felt to date in Indian polity. In this respect, one of the aspects of Dhamma was state taking the responsibility of the healthcare system. Ashoka\u2019s second Rock Edict prescribes building hospitals, dispensaries and planting herbs useful in medicine, and the healing of humans and animals. These are facilities that practise free outpatient care mimicking a contemporary Indian welfare-state policy such as the Ayushman Bharat which aims to deliver on health care to financially insecure citizens. The policy research identifies that the compassionate nature of the modern Indian policies does not have its roots in colonial intervention or from the economic liberalisation post 1991 but the policy framework has been influenced from Ashoka\u2019s Dhamma. 2.3 In the Times Pallavas and Cholas The Pallava and Chola dynasties were pioneers in establishing state-supported healthcare systems in South India, reflecting an early form of public welfare. This section will explore their contributions to the development of village dispensaries and town hospitals, showcasing how their efforts laid the foundation for current welfare systems in India. More examples of state sponsored health care systems/ The first example of state supported health care organisations can be traced back to ancient South India to the government organisations which were under two dynasties known as the Pallava and the Chola Empires International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 5 during the 6th and 13th century c.e. Information regarding dispensaries and treatment as public duties and the feasibility of health care services can be found in epigraphical texts from the Pallava period (CE 574-879). Likewise in the Chola phase we get an account of support for establishment of village dispensaries, town hospitals and providing other local medical facilities.. It was structured during this time and the use of terms such as atulasalai or vaidyasalai for dispensaries became very common. A notable example of the referenced inscription is from 1226 CE in Andhra Pradesh. This inscription, found on a stone pillar in Malakapur, details a donation made by Kakatiya Queen Rudramma and her father Ganapati. With the income from these lands allocated for a maternity home, a hospital, and a school, they gifted several villages. This highlights the philanthropic efforts of rulers in supporting healthcare and education during that period. which recorded that Kakatiya Queen Rudramma together with her father Ganapati donated lands towards the establishment of a home for pregnant women and a maternity home, a hospital and a school. This proves how royal they are to the public wellbeing whereby the kings and queens are seen as pious and philanthropic for supporting the health cause. The similarities with the current Indian public policies are visible, in fact, the schemes like Ayushman Bharat. As these antiquity dictators poured their money into education and building facilities, modern-day policies are to support accessible healthcare for economically unstable citizens. A proper understanding of a state\u2019s part in funding and managing healthcare has historical antecedents that are traced back to the Chola, Pallava period to contemporary India. These historical practices reveal that the need for welfare schemes and protection was recognized long before contemporary times. The principles underlying these ancient and medieval welfare measures resonate with modern policies, such as the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, which aims to provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to economically vulnerable sections of society. Similarly, historical policies reflected an understanding of the importance of supporting the disadvantaged and maintaining social stability. By examining these historical precedents, we see that the concept of welfare is deeply ingrained in Indian tradition and governance. The evolution of welfare policies from ancient and medieval times to the present underscores a continuous commitment to addressing societal needs and ensuring the well-being of all citizens. The modern welfare schemes are, therefore, part of a long-standing tradition of social responsibility and protection, adapting to contemporary challenges while rooted in a rich historical legacy. 2.4 Chronicles of Travellers In the intricate narrative of ancient Indian history accounts of travellers serve as vital sources of information. Their writings, filled with detailed descriptions and reflections, not only document the historical landscape but also reflect on the firsthand experiences that approach history with a more nuanced perspective, hence helping us avoid the biases that may have coloured the writings of court historians and chronicles. Historical accounts of travellers such as Fa Xian and Hiuen Tsang provide invaluable insights into ancient India\u2019s welfare systems, particularly in healthcare. Their observations of hospitals and charitable institutions offer a glimpse into early state-supported public services. This section examines their contributions and how these historical systems connect with today\u2019s welfare programs like Ayushman Bharat. The two most renowned Chinese travellers of the time were Fa Xian and Hiuen Tsang. They emerged as pivotal figures unfolding their journeys like epic tales that traverse the vast subcontinent \u2022 FA XIANG Fa Xiang (CEE 405-411) a Chinese Buddhist monk, travelled to India primarily to obtain sacred Buddhist International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 6 texts and to understand the practices of Buddhism. This journey led him to the region of Magadha, where he came to visit Bodh Gaya (the revered site of Buddha\u2019s enlightenment). During his time there, Fa Xiang observed and encountered the societal structure within the Mauryan Empire and his experiences prompted him to document extensive volumes on the social structure and cultural dynamics of that era. His observation from around the early 5th century CE. provide one of the earliest accounts of charitable dispensaries in ancient India. According to Fa Xiang, these dispensaries were established in Pataliputra (modern-day Patna) and were open to the sick from all communities. The mention of such facilities indicates that public health infrastructure was already in place during this period, catering to people regardless of their social or economic background. These dispensaries offered free medical care and acted as important centres for public welfare, mirroring the concept of state responsibility for healthcare. These accounts highlight the existence of a state-supported healthcare system where medical services were provided without charge. This is particularly significant as it shows how rulers, even in the early centuries, saw the need to create a system of healthcare that was inclusive and accessible to all, much like today\u2019s Ayushman Bharat initiative. The charitable nature of these dispensaries suggests a moral and ethical commitment to healthcare, ensuring that the most vulnerable and marginalised had access to medical treatment\u2014a principle that aligns with the modern welfare state. \u2022 HIUEN TSANG Roughly two centuries later, Hiuen Tsang (CE 629-645) , another renowned Chinese traveller, provided further details on India\u2019s ancient healthcare system during his travels. He described the presence of hospices (punya-salas) along the highways in towns and villages. These hospices, which served both travellers and the local population, provided food, drink, and medical care, and were staffed by physicians who treated the poor and the sick. These institutions, called punyasthanas, dharmashalas, and viharas, not only offered medical services but also embodied a holistic approach to public welfare by catering to both physical and social needs. These were the Indian counterparts of the western almshouses, monasteries and infirmaries of those times. 3. DECENTRALIZATION POLICY: PANCHAYATI RAJ AND THE ECHO OF GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY The decentralisation of governance through the Panchayati Raj system has long standing foundations in India, where local governance has long been a feature of village life. This section will explore the evolution of decentralised governance from ancient India to modern times, highlighting how the Panchayati Raj system is a continuation of traditional self-governance practices. The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments of the Indian Constitution marked a pivotal shift in India\u2019s framework of governance by introducing Panchayati Raj institutions and Urban Local bodies as a third-tier system of local governance tailored for rural and urban areas respectively. This resulted in an administrative reform while also leading to a fundamental restructuring of the way governance operates at the local level, recognizing the need for a decentralised and participatory democracy. There exist several schools of thought that revolve around the origin of this system citing evidence of democratic institutions in ancient Greece, feudalism in Europe and social meetings and gatherings held under a banyan tree in ancient India. One set of scholars have been heavily influenced by western political thought and claim that the principles of decentralisation were borrowed from the western experience and adapted to Indian settings. Yet another school of thought contends that the idea of local governance and decentralisation in India is not imported from the west but rather its origin is deeply rooted in India\u2019s histo- International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 7 rical and cultural traditions. 3.1 The Non-Centralized v/s Decentralized Systems of Governance The debate, however, becomes complex when historians attempt to differentiate between decentralized and non-centralized systems of governance. Unlike the modern state where power is often centralized and subsequently devolved to local authorities through formal processes of decentralization, many ancient Indian politics were non-centralized by design. The bottom-up approach in ancient India, where governance organically flowed from local to higher levels, makes it difficult to categorise these systems strictly as decentralized in the modern sense. In these non-centralized political structures, local units enjoyed autonomy without a centralised authority overseeing them. Hence, these systems might be better described as prototypes of federations, where power was distributed rather than devolved. Decentralization, in its contemporary form, implies the existence of a central authority that intentionally disperses power to local bodies. 3.2 Ancient Indian Polity Nevertheless there exists enough evidence to support the perspective stating that the decentralized system of governance was an integral part of early Indian polity. Villages were self-governing units, with gram sabhas (village assemblies) playing a pivotal role in local administration. The existence of sabhas and samitis at different levels indicate the operation of governance structures that closely mirror modern decentralization efforts. This supports the argument that India's local governance systems were indigenous creations rather than being transplanted from Western thought. 3.2.1 Emergence of Ancient Indian Communities Since prehistoric times humans have exhibited a natural tendency to sustain themselves through community and group living. For activities such as hunting, gathering, and protection from wild animals, cooperation within a group was essential for survival. The collection of resources and the execution of essential tasks could not be efficiently managed by a single individual over time. Living in groups, however, inherently brings about the need for moral and ethical dilemmas, necessitating the formation of rules and social norms to ensure collective well-being. These had to be imparted in individuals through governance and moral order that has persisted throughout history. In the context of India, ancient village communities often convened under banyan trees to discuss and resolve issues. Over time, the authority of the village head, initially chosen and later nominated, expanded significantly, encompassing judicial, administrative, and other critical powers. Early kings largely distanced themselves from village matters, focusing primarily on revenue collection rather than local governance. Resembling the current decentralisation policy in India, this system reflects the same principles of entrusting local governance to communities, prioritizing local involvement and reducing reliance on distant central authorities. 3.2.2 Evidences of Democratic Governance in Vedic and Puranic Periods Today the world recognises Greece as the birthplace of democracy, with Cleisthenes, the father of democracy, leading the way around 500 BCE. However, history tells a richer tale and evidence from around the world proving that Greece was not alone in shaping this monumental concept. In fact, far to the east, India, often overlooked in this narrative, holds its own legacy of a democratic governance. (in vedas, Upanishads and manusmriti) We find traces of self- governing villages in depictions of Rig Veda, one of the oldest sacred texts in the International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 8 world, originating from ancient India that was composed between 1500-1000 BCE. It mentions the existence of various tribes and clans often headed by a chief known as Gramini. He enjoyed a high status in the village much like a \u201csarpanch\u201d in today\u2019s settings and besides being in- charge of the defence, he also had administrative, judicial and revenue collecting powers. 3.3 Principles of Village Administration in Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra Arthashastra in the form of an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy composed by Kautilya (most famously known as Chanakya) is a handbook for the guidance of the governing group or rather a manual for participating politicians or leaders. Kautilya who was a scholar and advisor in the court of Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire in 321 BCE in this treatise had given a detailed explanation of panchayati system significantly focusing on the nature and functions of the village chiefs/ Gramini, duties of other local representatives and the involvement of citizens or people residing in villages. Much like the way today\u2019s Panchayati Raj system grants local governance bodies the authority to legislate and manage affairs at the grassroots level, Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra also emphasized on the executive and legislative powers of the village heads. The Panchayats, with their executive responsibility for implementing government schemes, echo the administrative roles Kautilya assigned to village officials, who were tasked with executing decisions and managing local resources. Moreover, just as Gram Nyayalayas today resolve minor disputes at the village level, Kautilya's framework also recognized the importance of local dispute resolution, highlighting the enduring significance of empowering local governance both in ancient and modern times 3.4 Records Of Foreign Travellers Apart from the wealth of evidence provided by indigenous sources, the accounts of foreign travellers also offer compelling proof of the existence of a Panchayati Raj system or the practice of local governance in Indian villages. Notably Megasthenes, who served as the Greek ambassador at the court of Chandragupta Maurya around 302 BCE, recorded detailed observations of India\u2019s decentralized governance in his renowned work, Indica. He described a well-organised village administration divided into six departments, each catering to different societal needs, thus affirming the indigenous nature of local governance. These records defy the claim that decentralized governance in India was a western import, instead they highlight its ancient and structured presence. Furthermore, during the Gupta period, which is also known as the Golden Age of Indian history, the Chinese traveller Fa Xian extensively documented the effective functioning of village Panchayats. His accounts, written in the early 5th century CE, provide further evidence of the continuity and sophistication of India\u2019s village governance systems. These historical records, from both Greek and Chinese travellers, substantiate the enduring legacy of indigenous local governance, deeply rooted in Indian society long before any western influence. The Panchayati Raj system reflects India\u2019s historical commitment to decentralization and local governance. By empowering local bodies, modern policies continue the tradition of village self-governance, showing that contemporary decentralization efforts are firmly rooted in India\u2019s ancient administrative practices.

ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT: SPINNING THE WHEEL OF SELF-RELIANCE Throughout the tumultuous tides of India\u2019s history and beneath the ever \u2013 evolving symbols of India\u2019s flags, one humble yet iconic object that has remained constant in India\u2019s history\u2013 is the charkha or the spinning wheel (Persian origin charkh (\u0686\u0631\u062e)- meaning wheel). More than just a household item, the charkha during the freedom movement became the very heartbeat of a people yearning for freedom, embodying the essence of self-reliance. As the nations\u2019 collective consciousness awakened, the charkha, binding the hopes of millions in its thread, symbolized the desire to break free from the shackles of exploitation and foreign domination. That same spirit, first woven into the fabric of India\u2019s freedom struggle resonates even today in a scheme implying a path of self-reliance. Atmanirbhar Bharat policy launched by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the year 2020 was declared as a new vision and idea for the Indian Economy and social development to deal with problems that were to arise in the post covid period. However, as the name suggests \u201cAtmanirbhar\u201d (Sanskrit origin: atman- self and nirbhar -dependent) it can be largely viewed as a modern-day adaptation of the concept of self-reliance having its roots in the ancient Indian philosophy. Modi himself in the inaugural speech took to mention about the concept as a cornerstone for future development and stated that the \u201cvery idea\u201d of an Atmanirbhar Bharat was a product of age-old \u201csanskriti,\u201d or culture, and \u201csamskara,\u201d or character, having its roots in Hindu religious scriptures such as the Vedas and Shastras. His explanation was liberally peppered with Sanskrit quotes, ostensibly to add the heft of ancient wisdom to this doctrine of the future. He quoted the Mundakupanishad, and said \u201ce\u1e63a va\u1e25 pantha\u1e25\u201d\u2014this is your road, to demonstrate why self-reliance was essential. Besides having a Vedic essence, a similar approach was used at the time of freedom struggle during the Swadeshi movement. Gandhi expressed his view of Swadeshi as a strong economy, decentralisation of power in villages and encouraging the local and less industrialised. His view was that India\u2019s economic future lay in Charkha and Khadi; \u201cIf India\u2019s villages are to live and prosper, the charkha must become universal.\u201d (Harijan, 1939). Having now observed that the idea of self-reliance, which is at the forefront of this policy is no novel idea but rather a resurgence of a deep-seated vision that has shaped India\u2019s governance for centuries, sections down below trace the enduring legacy of the concept from ancient India to present day and reveal how the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat is but the latest chapter in much longer story of India\u2019s economic sovereignty. 4. 1 State-Driven Craftsmanship and Domestic Production in Vijayanagara Empire Much like today\u2019s emphasis on internal production and reduced dependency on foreign imports, the 14th century Vijayanagar Empire situated on the Deccan Plateau in Southern India was built on a foundation of agricultural self-sufficiency and thriving domestic industry. Medieval India, like other feudal societies, had its economy based on agriculture and a great majority of the population was connected with land. However, the centuries immediately preceding large- scale European colonisation of the subcontinent, were times of considerable change in Southern India. This period was marked by intensification of craft products and expansion of international and internal commerce. In fact apart from agriculture many other industries had flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries. If after agriculture there was any sector in the Vijayanagar empire that had contributed to the economy the most then it was the industrial sector. The economic structure of the village community crafts notably domestic industries in the peasant households contributed to the economy of that time, and agriculture and industrial production came to be recognised as twin pillars of economy. The industry was linked inseparably with domestic production. The crafts separated from agriculture resulted in further International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 10 development of production, first represented by a combination of handicrafts production for the market with agriculture produced in peasant households and second, carried on by professional artisans. The period between A.D. 1500 AND A.D. 1600 constitutes an important landmark in the history of Vijayanagar Empire. While the empire, under Tuluva ruler- Krishnadevaraya, was engaging in international trade, particularly with the Portuguese and Southeast Asian countries, the governance made sure that the core of its economy relied on internal production and consumption which significantly contributed to the long- term sustainability of the Empire. The towns of the Vijayanagar Empire became bustling centres of economic activity, where craftsmen and artisans thrived under the state\u2019s patronage. The artisans usually came to settle down in the temple towns and these being the nuclei led to the concentration of industries in such areas. The development of trade between the town and the local village was closely connected with the production of commodities in town. Among the different factors affecting industries, the multifaceted role of state policy is important. It is well known that an important part of the administrative doctrine of medieval India suggested that the state should take care of economic prosperity and provide employment and protection to traders and craftsmen. The court was a great employer and a customer's strong central power meant peace and stability, which was required for economic growth. Moreover, as Atmanirbhar Bharat places a special emphasis on revitalizing and empowering textile industry through Production-Linked Scheme (PLI) and Mega Investment Textile Parks (MITRA), Vijayanagar Empire was also renowned for its state-supported textile production, especially cotton and silk fabrics. Weavers, spinners, and dyers played a significant role in the economy, producing textiles for both local consumption and trade within India. In medieval literature, loom is a part of innumerable poetic similes and metaphors. It appears that the spinning wheel with the crank handle was introduced in India only in the 14th century by the Turks. The heyday of the weaving industry in the Vijayanagar Empire was during the 15th and 16th centuries when kings provided an added impetus to textile production giving facilities and privileges to weavers and traders of cloth. An inscription from Tirupati dated 1538 gives some information about the extent of specialisation in different types of weaving. It also gives information regarding the extent of technological specialisation. The development of certain industries in the Vijayanagar Empire leads to the conclusion that the demand for cloth, especially fine cotton, must have gone up. During the 15th century and to some extent in the early 16th century, textile trade continued to be in the hands of indigenous merchant guilds. 4.2 Atmanirbhar Bharat in Gandhian Philosophy As the world moves towards modernisation, many ideas practised and preached by Mahatma Gandhi are becoming increasingly relevant as guides to state policy. The most interesting, and understandably controversial, of his favourite ideas is that of Atmanirbhar Bharat or local self-reliance. Having its roots in the Indian Swadeshi movement and as a staunch advocate of \u201cswaraj\u201d (meaning self-rule) Gandhi from the very beginning emphasised on localism and the importance of self-reliant villages, promoting the growth of domestic or small- scale industries, thereby supporting village-level economies. By popularising khadi (derived from the word khaddar i.e. hand spun natural fibre cloth) and the use of the charkha, Gandhi sought to foster a spirit of independence and sustainability within the local economy, empowering communities to produce for themselves and reduce reliance on external forces. From handloom to freedom the charkha and the khadi movement encouraged Indians to spin their own cloth (khadi) instead of using British textiles. His emphasis on local crafts, handicrafts and self-sustaining economies mirrors the ethos of \u201cvocal for local\u201d where local products elevated the ideology of self-reliance International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 11 and self-government. Moreover Gandhi, being acutely aware of the widespread poverty and lack of education among a large section of India\u2019s population, believed that any planning that overlooked the need to absorb labour wealth would be fundamentally flawed (for India). He argued that centralised methods of production, regardless of their output capacity, were incapable of providing employment to the vast number of people in need of work. For him, sustainable development in India had to focus on labour-intensive strategies that uplifted the masses, ensuring both economic productivity and social inclusion. The launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920 marked the period when boycott of foreign goods and services, for the very first time, was promoted on a large-scale as a part of a mass movement. The advantages to Indian mill-owners would be obvious and appreciation of them would doubtless swing over to the movement with the support of a wealthy and powerful community. Under Gandhi\u2019s leadership the widespread boycott became the key strategy in undermining British economic interests while fostering swadeshi, or the use of indigenous goods, which symbolised India\u2019s quest for self-reliance and resistance to colonial rule. 5. RESERVATION POLICY: CHARTING THE EVOLUTION AND NSTITUTIONALISATION OF MARGINALISATION The reservation policy in India is a vital part of its affirmative action efforts, designed to address historical injustices and ensure fair representation of marginalized communities. Rooted in the Indian Constitution, this policy allocates specific quotas in education, employment, and government institutions to groups systematically disadvantaged by caste-based discrimination, including Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC). The primary objective of the reservation policy is to level the playing field, counteracting centuries of social exclusion by promoting social and economic mobility for these communities. By reserving seats in government jobs, educational institutions, and legislative bodies, the policy creates avenues for these groups to participate more fully in India\u2019s economic and social life. Beyond simply setting quotas, reservation reflects a broader commitment to social justice, inclusivity, and building a society with equal opportunity for all its citizens. The roots of this marginalization lie in ancient India's rigid social structure, specifically the concept of varna. In this system, society was divided into four main classes: Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), and Shudras (laborers). The Shudras occupied the lowest position in this hierarchy, deprived of many rights, including the freedom to work in specific occupations or access education and religious practices. Over time, this hierarchical structure became hereditary, further entrenching inequalities and giving rise to the caste system. As the caste system evolved, the Shudras, and those considered outside the varna system altogether, became the \"untouchables.\" This group faced severe social, economic, and political exclusion. Denied fundamental civil rights and opportunities, they bore the brunt of societal discrimination, which endured for generations and left a lasting legacy of inequality in Indian society. The impact of these historical injustices is still evident in modern Indian society, where marginalized communities continue to face challenges in accessing opportunities. The reservation policy, therefore, is a response to this legacy, designed to support those groups who have been denied their fair share of resources and social mobility. By linking past injustices to present efforts, reservation policies aim to foster a more inclusive society, offering historically disadvantaged groups a path toward empowerment International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 12 and equality. 5.1 Rig Veda\u2019s Mention of the Four Varnas \u2013 Institutionalizing Brahmanical Superiority The Hindu caste system is described in the Rig Veda (composed between 1500-1000 BCE): one of the oldest Hindu texts. The text consists of numerous suktas (hymns) that convey spiritual and philosophical teachings. Among these, one is Purusha Sukta or the cosmic man whose body symbolizes the origins of the four varnas/classes: the Brahmins as his head, the Kshatriyas as his arms, the Vaishyas as his thighs, and the Shudras as his feet These four varnas were supposedly originally conceived as occupational categories. To begin with, it was an assignment of working in turn and was used as a way of organizing labour. Nonetheless, it developed rapidly and turned into a caste system in which social class was hereditary and castes were fixed. At the top of this pyramid, the Bramins enjoyed the principle of spiritual authority, and the pontificate was compounded by conferring scholarship that enabled them to control most religious and social activities. The Brahmanical class assimilated much power for itself, accepting religious sanction regarding its authority to uphold the caste system. This institutionalization of caste superiority in the society not only resulted in a stratified society, but also completely suppressed social mobility for the lower caste people. The consequences of this historical separation do, however, continue to exist in the present in the form of today\u2019s enduring socio-economic inequalities to which contemporary public policies are responding. Today, born from this kind of structure, several policies including the reservations where the intention has been to give a voice and a chance to those who were previously dominated by this structure. Present-day India seeks to address societal inequalities by confronting the prejudices that emerged from the varna system and working towards rectifying these disparities. Against the historical backdrop of the Rig Veda, the evolution of modern public policies reflects a continuous struggle against institutionalized inequality. This ongoing effort highlights the importance of anti-discrimination measures in the pursuit of social justice. 5.2 Discrimination in Post-Brahmanical Society As the Brahmanical social order evolved, later texts like the Manusmriti further entrenched caste-based discrimination. These texts outlined stringent behavioral norms and imposed restrictions on interactions between castes, especially between the so-called \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d castes. This era marked the emergence of untouchability, relegating specific groups, particularly the Dalits, to a status of impurity and effectively ostracizing them from society. The Dalit or Untouchables were deprived of even the rights to own land, education, and attend pompous religious ceremonies. Being locked into occupations that rendered them impure such as manual scavenging, they were socially isolated which reinforced economic subordination and exclusion. Such systemic discrimination had become rampant, a proof that independent India required public policies to have an effect on the deep-rooted inequalities that had set in over several decades. Consequently, the policies of reservation turned out as significant regula-tions as corrective measures to establish the lower castes in education, employment and political sectors. Since these groups of people suffered injustices that confined them to the peripheries of society, current policies in the civillized world seek to extend social and economical support to these people. This juxtaposition of historical evolution of caste discrimination and the policy making show persistent work being done on eradicating discrimination and reinventing equal society in a society which is yet to shed its historical sins. 5.3 Pre-Independence Period- Untouchables The British colonial government used the society of India and especially the caste system to their advent- International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 13 age. Although they ruled India, but did not initiate major socio-legal reforms towards the society \u2013 while women\u2019s practice of Sati was banned and girl marriage restricted, the caste system did not suffer a similar fate most probably due to lack of interest by the British in toppling it. This inaction led to the stiffening of caste structures The continuing failure to take meaningful action. However, the early part of the 20th century saw a change mainly with the emergence of the untouchability movement led by leaders such as Dr.B.R.Ambedkar. His pressure for their integration in the systems of education, employment, and even politics called for prompt structural reform. Ambedkar who was most instrumental in framing the Indian Constitution made a dramatic change in eradicating the caste prejudices that were carried in the newly independent Indian state. The Constitution was adopted in 1950 and actually contains no provisions that let discrimination be conducted based on caste, but it annihilates such act by protecting the rights of equal section of citizens through Article 15; however, the constitution of India uses the concept of positive discrimination in the shape of reservations for SCs and STs. These measures aimed to rectify historical injustices and provide marginalised groups with access to opportunities in modern India. The evolution from colonial exploitation to constitutional safeguards illustrates how the legacy of caste has influenced contemporary public policies, reinforcing the nation\u2019s commitment to social equity and inclusion. 5.4 Debate Over Its Relevance Today The reservation system in India was initially established as a temporary measure to uplift marginalised communities and ensure their participation in society. However, decades later, the continuation of these policies has sparked intense debates about their relevance in the modern context. Proponents argue that systemic inequality persists despite legal protections. They highlight the underrepresentation of Dalits and other backward classes in higher education, government positions, and the private sector as evidence of the ongoing need for affirmative action. Supporters contend that reservation policies have dismantled some barriers, granting marginalised communities access to education, employment, and political representation. As they pointed out, without these measures those groups would remain marginalized and restricted. On the other hand, people say that reservation, which was required at the time of independence, has led to the formation of castes which were to be eradicated. They say that such policies help aggravate split identity, which promotes casteist politics. Nowadays, one can hear more and more often that people belonging to reservations should use the caste system not only to select individuals, but as the basis of division into classes. It has resulted in the introduction of the recent quota famously known as the economically weaker section (EWS) quota targeting those who are economically disadvantaged but can be from any caste. Development of the reservation policy that took place accords with the permanent struggle to weigh social justice with economic feasibility, especially with the appearance of the EWS reservations in 2019. This policy debate has an echo of the Indian reality that casted oppression coexists with new forms of marginalisation. The debate on reservations today shows that historical crimes define modern policy making and requires proper analysis of the ways to get equity in a new society. CONCLUSION Therefore, the paper shows that history remains an important determinant of modern Indian public policies. It is within the background of such historical transformations, cultural worldview and societal change that the contemporary policy structure in India has evolved as discussed in this paper. It can therefore be seen from the foregoing that Indian polity has been in a welfare and governance phenomenon International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240629987 Volume 6, Issue 6, November-December 2024 14 since the Vedic period to Mauryan, Gupta and colonial forms of governments. So, the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, and the concept of Panchayati Raj are not only governing concepts of the present age but the outcome of the ideas prevalent for centuries in terms of public health insurance, justice distribution and decentralisation of power. Programs such as Ayushman Bharat by the government also prove how policies today are still an early form of ancient Indian welfare policies for the poor, thus stressing that public policies are not simply conventional or consequent, but are syndromes of cultural-historical roots in India that continue to build on their past. Moreover the reservation policy, for example which aims at redressing the exclusion of a particular category of people, has its historical roots in the caste system created by Hindu scriptures such as Rig Veda. While these ancient practices supported continued enduring social imbalances, many current public policies strive to redress such injustices, and, therefore, represent a persistent effort to temper the historical imbalances with contemporary equity. The discussion of this paper reveals that the Indian policy cycle reinvents history and patterns of the existing society and hence bringing about the policy. Incrementalism as explained implies that the policies do not take drastic turns, a fact we have come across. On the contrary they are more or less gradualistic, innovatively transforming old solutions to contemporary problems. This method of governance is in tune with the culture and population of a diverse nation like India where change and particularly big bang change is not easy to bring about. Besides, as this paper also shows, welfare programmes, such as Ayushman Bharat, are not novelties but products of the continuity of earlier forms of governmentalities that embraced the welfare of everyone. In some respects these reflect the successive layers of Indian governance philosophies which may have changed over the millennia but have not broken from their base values at any point of time. Therefore it can be said that history has a significant influence over present day Public Policies of India. Ancient structures of governance, religious scriptures, colonial history and post-colonial evolution have produced a cumulative but continuous political policy making process that intermingles traditional and contemporary concerns. In the future, it will be important to appreciate these historical factors playing a pivotal role in constructing fairly good and compliant policy measures. REFERENCE: 1.

india](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century.jpg)\n\nMountain High Maps\u00ae\n\n\u00a91995 Digital Wisdom, Inc.\n\n\u201cThe first and most essential thing to learn about India,\u201d declared a famous British administrator in 1888, is \u201cthat there is not, and never was an India, or even any country of India, possessing, according to European ideas, any sort of unity, physical, political, social or religious.\u201d1 The statement sounds startlingly silly until one notices the defining clause, \u201caccording to European ideas.\u201d Then one can change it to read, \u201cOne of the most essential things to learn about India is to not try to fit it into a European idea of what is essential for India.\u201d Confusion arises because the term \u201cIndia\u201d has been used, by both foreigners and Indians, for four quite different entities. India is, first of all, a geographic term for the subcontinental region demarcated by the great sweep of hills and mountains from the northwest on the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal on the northeast, and bordered on two sides by those seas and the Indian Ocean. The ancient literature makes clear its people were aware of this distinctive, well defined land mass.\n\n![Image 16: an old manuscript with text on it](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century0.jpg)\n\nEighteenth-century manuscript of the Rig Veda. The Rig Veda was composed before 1200 BCE.

It was the civilization of many kingdoms and empires from Kashmir to Tamilnadu, but was not exclusively identified with any particular one. This civilization not only dominated territorial India but was exported throughout Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Then India is used for a third India, best known to the Western world from the empire established in the subcontinent by Great Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, although the word was not officially used until 1833 when the East India Company official who had been known as Governor-General of Fort William in Bengal was designated Governor-General of India by the British Parliament.\n\n![Image 17: a crest](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century1.jpg)\n\nEast India Company Coat of Arms Source: The East India Company: Trade and Conquest from 1600 by Antony Wild. Published by First Lyons Press, 2002.\n\nThe fourth India is, of course, the modern nation-state which became independent in 1947, making using \u201cIndia\u201d for the first time the name of a sovereign state. While its geographic inheritance is only part of the territorial India that had been ruled by Britain, it claims as its historical inheritance the civilizations, cultures, and political states that have flourished in the region for millennia. Here is the source of tensions and passions in relations with Pakistan, the other successor state of imperial India, in quarrels over its sovereignty in Kashmir and with China over other border areas in the Northeast. Probably most important for the future, however, is the claim made by powerful groups in contemporary India that Indian nationalism must be defined in terms of the second India, of the culture that was indigenous to the region, which they define as Hindutva, the culture of Hindu India.\n\n### **2 NARRATIVE ACCOUNTS OF INDIAN HISTORY ARE NECESSARILY CONFUSING AND MISLEADING**\n\n![Image 18: a pillar with carved lion details](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century2.jpg)\n\nSymbol of the Republic of India adopted in 1948.\n\nThe peoples of India have always reflected on their past, their social origins, and their history in ways of fundamental importance for understanding intellectual and social ideas. These ways, however, did not always conform to western\u2014nor, it should be noted, to Chinese or Islamic\u2014historiography. What confused Europeans when they began studying Indian culture\u2014and Indians who used the methodologies of modern European scholarship\u2014was that India\u2019s past was a living reality, the past intertwined in the present. The vast body of Indian literature, a modern Indian historian points out, shows how \u201cthe variety of structural forms of social relations, the intricacy of their interconnections and the long course of the historical evolution of these forms through social struggle\u201d are stamped on the living beliefs and practices of the people. 2 Their past, the Indianness of India, is always palpable to the people of present day India.\n\nThe narrative of Indian history is also confusing because it lacks a political core on which to base a narrative. Seven centuries of invasions and rule by foreigners, with the accounts written by them, made a dispiriting national narrative for generations of Indians. \u201cWhether unintentional or not,\u201d a British historian commented, \u201cno greater spiritual injury can be done to a people than to teach them to despise the achievements of their forefathers. To overvalue them can hardly be a mistake.\u201d3 The evaluation of the past was a critical project for modern India, and to a very considerable extent, the Indian nationalist movement involved the appropriation of the Indian past to define the nation, the integration of India\u2019s complex, often contradictory, past into a national narrative.\n\n### **3 THE FOREIGN CONQUESTS OF THE INDIA SUBCONTINENT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF BOTH THE CONQUERED AND THE CONQUEROR**S\n\n![Image 19: illustration of people in military uniforms on horses ](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century3.jpg)\n\nDetail from a miniature of the Babur-nama, Sixteenth-\n\ncentury. National Museum of India, New Delhi. Source: India and the Moghal Dynasty by Val\u00e9rie Berinstain.\n\n\u00a91998 Thames and Hudson Ltd., London.\n\nIt may seem to be stating the obvious to argue that the foreign conquests in the Indian subcontinent must be understood in terms of the social and political conditions of both conquered and conquerors, but understanding many aspects of contemporary India depend precisely on this very difficult task, not yet adequately accomplished by scholars. Popular writing, including textbooks, newspapers, and even some scholarly works, still use such terminology as \u201cthe invasion of India,\u201d implying an attack on a political entity, comparable to a modern nationstate encompassing territorial India. The familiar phrase \u201cthe Muslim invasion of India\u201d must also be used with extreme care for a number of reasons. One is that there was no single state encompassing India, but many small kingdoms and principalities. Another is that the term \u201cMuslim invasion\u201d comes freighted from the contemporary world with connotations: terrorism rooted in a religious commitment to violence, a staple, unhappily, of political discourse in the United States and India at the beginning of the twenty-first 8 EDUCATION ABOUT ASIA Volume 8, Number 3 Winter 2003 century. The invasions were by groups of various ethnic origins who were adherents of Islam, and were attracted by the wealth of India. Arab traders, before they became Muslims, were active along the Indian coast, and it was Arab Muslims from Iraq who conquered Sind early in the eighth century. Later invaders were not Arabs, but Turkish chieftains from Central Asia who, beginning at the end of the tenth century, made inroads into North India, and by the middle of the fourteenth century had spread throughout much of India. The interest of these chieftains was the collection of revenue from the Indian peasants and merchants, not their conversion to Islam, although many thousands of the local people became its adherents.\n\nAfter centuries of Muslim rule, the population of India remained overwhelmingly Hindu, and trade, commerce, and the banking system were largely in the hands of Hindus, as was much of the bureaucracy. The next major intruders, the British, came not as an invading force sent by a nation, but as a group of traders, the East India Company, eager to make money. While it began trading in 1600, the East India Company did not become a political power in India until 1765 when it gained control of the revenues of Bengal, the richest province of the Mughal empire. Great Britain was then on the way to becoming a great industrial nation, self-confident in its military and political power. It came to an India of great cities, well-articulated political systems, enormous agricultural population, an ancient textile industry, large external and internal trade, and religious and literary traditions that had developed over the course of two thousand years. The coming together of these two civilizations set the stage for the development of modern India as a great nation in the twenty-first century.\n\n### **4 GREAT BRITAIN IMPOSED ON INDIA WHAT MANY INDIANS CONSIDER TO HAVE BEEN AN OPPRESSIVE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM, BUT INDIANS APPROPRIATED AND ADAPTED WHAT THEY NEEDED FROM THE WEST**\n\n**In the nineteenth century, the British were fond of cataloging the benefits their rule had brought to India: political unification, a western legal system, a system of university education, the English language, modern medicine, and modern communications.** This is more or less true in a formal sense, but it conceals what is of fundamental importance, namely, that the traditional Indian elites, working within the British system, appropriated what they needed for their own purposes. The most familiar example of this is the eagerness with which the Indian upper classes and upper castes adopted Western learning through the medium of English. The decision was made in 1835 that government support for higher education would go only to institutions that used English, and, from the very beginning, many members of the elite saw the advantage English gave them to acquire the learning of the West. From this followed quick access to the great institutions of the modern world\u2014the press, new professions, ideas of constitutional government, representative political institutions, science and technology, new industries. Study of this complex process of exchange and transformation is vital for understanding the nature of contemporary India.\n\n### **5 THERE WAS NOT ONE BUT MANY INDIAN NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS**\n\nIn our teaching and writing we tend to speak of the \u201cIndian nationalist movement,\u201d because of the organizational dominance of the Indian National Congress after its founding in 1885, which expressed itself in the idiom of contemporary British liberalism. This success of the Congress masked, however, that there were at least four other important strands in the opposition to British rule, all of which have been central to India\u2019s political discourse since Independence. One early challenge from Muslim leaders was that majority rule meant the denial of the right of groups to express their social and religious values through political structures. This challenge led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. In direct opposition to this position was the demand, always present among the membership of the Indian National Congress, that Hindu culture must be the basis of Indian nationalism. A third strand in the opposition to British rule was linked to claims from regional groups, such as the Tamils in South India, that they represented a culture different from that of the Indians from North India who were dominant in the Indian National Congress. This sub-nationalism did not deny the primacy of the Indian nation but insisted on the recognition of linguistic, religious, and historical differences. Then there were groups, not very vocal before independence, but increasingly afterwards, that argued for regional self-determination, claiming they had never been integrated into Indian empires, neither Mughal nor British. The so-called tribal people in the Northeast became spokesmen for the right of self-determination, along with groups in Kashmir and Punjab. Much of the politics of contemporary India reflects these divergent nationalisms.\n\n### **6 THE PARTITION OF INDIA IN 1947 MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED**\n\n**The most controversial questions in modern South Asian history have to do with the reasons for the Partition of what I have called the \u201cthird India,\u201d that is, British India, that led to the creation of two new nations, India and Pakistan, and eventually to a third, Bangladesh.** Could it have been avoided or was it inevitable? Who was primarily responsible? An immense literature, scholarly and popular, gives passionate and contradictory answers to these questions; but it seems possible that Partition might have been avoided if Nehru and the other leaders of the Indian National Congress had been more accommodating to M. A. Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League, more understanding of the demand that the rights of groups, not just of the majority, must be recognized. It is not certain what Jinnah would have settled for, but he might have accepted a constitutional arrangement that established states with strong powers and a central government that was relatively weak, concerned mainly with defense, foreign affairs, and currency. Nehru and the leaders of the Indian National Congress, however, wanted above all else a strong central government that would have the power to transform India\u2019s political and economic life, making it into a powerful nation. So it is possible to argue that if Nehru and the other Congress leaders had not been so intransigent, India could have remained undivided.\n\n### **7 FIVE GREAT COMMITMENTS OF THE NEHRU YEARS (1947\u201354) EXPRESSED INDIA\u2019S HOPES FOR THE FUTURE**\n\nIn a speech to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, on the eve of becoming the first prime minister of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru stated his certainty that India would advance \u201cin spite of obstructions and difficulties, and achieve and realize the dream that we have dreamed so long.\u201d4 In the following years, in the Constitution that was adopted in 1950 and in subsequent amendments, through acts of parliament, and through a multitude of books and speeches, Nehru and those who followed him gave expression to those dreams and tried to achieve them. They can be fairly summarized under five terms that are emphasized in the Constitution and a sixth that has certainly found frequent authoritative expression in other ways.\n\nThe Preamble to the Constitution, as amended in 1976, declares that the people of India have given to themselves \u201cA Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic\u201d that assures \u201cthe unity and integrity of the Nation.\u201d All of the terms relate, directly and indirectly, to the historical experience of the four Indias mentioned above. Some of them have been widely accepted as defining the nature of India, while others have been fiercely contested. All that can be done here is enumerate them, with brief comments.\n\n![Image 20: time magazine cover ](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century4.jpg)\n\nNehru on the cover of Time, December 14, 1956.\n\nSovereignty has, of course, special meaning to a people who had lost it on numerous occasions to foreigners, and now is intent on maintaining it against any attempts to diminish it. The \u201cunity of India\u201d is one of the most frequently used phrases in political discourse in India, with historic memories of how disunity made possible foreign conquest. The commitment to the practice of democracy has been demonstrated in elections which have been remarkably free of corruption in comparison with almost all other recently-decolonized countries. These three commitments have been widely accepted without much overt opposition.\n\nThe decision to declare a \u201csocialist\u201d country was done by a constitutional amendment in 1976. That a so seemingly momentous change was made without great opposition suggests that it was not intended to bring about the sweeping redistribution of wealth and power of the kind that took place in other socialist countries. In general, what was meant by socialism was, first of all, social justice for India\u2019s poverty-stricken masses, and the conviction of Nehru and others that this could only be obtained by central planning and government control of the economy. Much of the criticism of Nehru\u2019s policies, now widespread in India, has been directed at this state planning of the economy. There has, however, been no formal attempt to delete \u201csocialist\u201d from the Constitution as a defining characteristic of the Indian nation.\n\nSecularism, the fifth of the great Nehruvian commitments, in Indian constitutional usage does not carry as its primary dictionary meaning indifference to religion or antagonism to its beliefs. The word was added to the Preamble of the Constitution in 1976, but it was implicit in the articles in the original version of 1950, guaranteeing freedom of religion and declaring that the state would not support any particular religion and that all religions would be equal before the law. Christians, Muslims, and other minority religious groups were in favor of these clauses as they gave them the right to freely practice and propagate their faiths, but the constitutional guarantees also seemed to a great many Hindus, perhaps the majority, to express fundamental Indian attitudes towards religion. For members of all communities, the clauses seemed to promise relief from the communal strife between Hindus and Muslims. The opposition to secularism came, as noted later in number nine, from proponents of Hindu nationalism.\n\nThe sixth of the great commitments that defines India in the twenty-first century is that India must find the place that she deserves in the world community, not the one that foreign rulers previously assigned her. This conviction does not find a specific constitutional statement, but is surely implied in the Directive Principle that declares India would \u201cpromote peace and international security.\u201d5 Nehru\u2019s ambition was to make India the spokesman for what became known as the \u201cThird World,\u201d or the countries emerging from European control in Asia and Africa. Especially in the United Nations, India\u2019s representatives became the champion of anti-imperialism, denouncing the old imperial powers: Great Britain, France, and Portugal, as well as what they regarded as the new imperialism of the United States. The Soviet Union was seen as India\u2019s ally in this struggle.\n\n### **8 MAHATMA GANDHI IS AN ICON FOR INDIA AS A NATION**\n\n![Image 21: an old man smiling and holding his hands up in prayer](https://www.asianstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century5.jpg)\n\nGandhi greeting the crowds in Madras, 1946. Source: Gandhi by Peter R\u00a8uhe, \u00a92001 Phaidon Press Limited.\n\nOutsiders often ask about the relevance of Gandhi and his message for the India of the twenty-first century, with the world\u2019s fourth largest army, nuclear weapons, an industrialized, capitalist economy, and a consumer society that models itself on the United States. India also has a staggering burden of poverty and has experienced riots in which thousands of people have been killed in the name of religion. All of this suggests that Gandhi, the apostle of peace and non-violence, of compassion for the poor, of simplicity in life-styles, no longer has influence. How can he be an icon for India as a nation? An icon is, literally, a pictorial representation used to center one\u2019s attention during religious devotions. Gandhi is not an icon in that sense, although there are many thousands of statues of him throughout India and one in the heart of Washington, DC. He is an icon for India in the sense that he is remembered for what he did to make India into a free and vibrant nation, not for teachings that Indians know and follow. He is also an icon for India in another, and very modern, sense. An icon on a computer desktop suggests the availability of a function, but its relevance depends on the knowledge and needs of the user, not on the function itself. This is not a bad paraphrase of what Gandhi meant when he said to his people: \u201cDeluded by modern western civilization, we have forgotten our ancient civilization and worship the might of arms.\u201d6\n\n### **9 HINDU NATIONALISM CLAIMS TO BE THE AUTHENTIC VOICE OF INDIA FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY**\n\n**Who speaks for India? This was an urgent domestic question throughout the twentieth century as Indians increasingly began to speak of independence and freedom from British rule. By 1946 it was clear the Indian National Congress spoke for the majority of Indians, but not for most of the vast Muslim minority.** After independence, the Congress claim to speak for India became less and less tenable, especially as noted in number seven of Top Ten Things, by those critical of its commitment to secularism.\n\nThe opponents of secularism have formed organizations, notably the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), that have been successful in winning support in many segments of society. This indicates the superior organizational skills of their leaders, as well as their ability to articulate an appealing version of the nationalist project, which they can translate into electoral support and mobilization of crowds to demonstrate and, very frequently, to take violent action.\n\nRecognition of the political importance of the RSS began with the strong showing in electoral contests made in the 1950s and 1960s by the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a political party that drew many leaders from the RSS. Its role in Indian politics increased with the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the successor of the Jana Sangh. Its success is indicated by electoral statistics: in the elections of 1984, it won two seats; in 1991, it won 122; and in 1998 it became the major party in India\u2019s ruling coalition. The RSS and its membership could now truly claim that its nationalist project had become central in the mainstream of India\u2019s political discourse.\n\nHindu nationalism rejects the central tenet of secularism that religion is a private matter. \u201cWe make war or peace, engage in arts and crafts, amass wealth and give it away\u2014indeed we are born and die\u2014all in accord with religious injunctions.\u201d7 The success of the RSS depends, to a considerable extent, upon the skillful appeal to the greatness of India\u2019s past, real or imagined, and the conditions, again, real or imagined, of the contemporary world. There is little question that Hindu nationalism will remain a major force in Indian social and political life.\n\n### **10 INDIA HAS A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY THAT HELPS TO ASSURE ITS DEMOCRATIC FUTURE**\n\nThe last of my Top Ten Things, while based on the historical analyses attempted in the other nine, moves to the uncertain ground of forecasting the future. There has been much internal violence in India in the years since Independence, but not only has the nation survived, it has been governed by democratically elected governments; it has fought wars with two of its neighbors, Pakistan and China; it has faced internal uprisings in Kashmir, Punjab, and the Northeast; it has endured horrendous religious riots; it has suffered from the natural disasters of earthquakes and famines.\n\nThat India has not only survived all these shocks and traumas but emerged a strong and vibrant state has been explained in many ways, but the general explanation seems to be that even before Independence, India had a functioning civil society and that this has been greatly strengthened through years. Civil society is understood, in broadest terms, as an autonomous arena free from state control, sometimes cooperating with the state but often in opposition or in rivalry with some of the state\u2019s functions as it defines public issues and defends its autonomy. While many of the institutions of civil society have immediate links with institutions in the Western world, they are deeply embedded in the indigenous social structures and historical experiences of the South Asian subcontinent. 8 Science, technology, communications, and democracy should not be seen as artifacts of the West, but the common inheritance of the modern world. The Internet, so ubiquitous in modern India, is a familiar example as is the Indian cinema, so often deplored by Indian intellectuals for distorting the realities of modern India. M. V. Kamath, the well-known journalist, makes a cogent argument, however, that the cinema is peculiarly Indian, cutting across class and regional differences, giving access to the principles by which the society \u201cattempts to organize and conceptualize its experience.\u201d9 Broadly speaking, the development of democracy in India is closely related to activities of civil society, for while civil society may exist to some degree in a non-democratic political order, democracy surely cannot exist, in India or anywhere, without the activities of civil society. These activities include, in no particular order, social service organizations, organized sports, aspects of popular culture such as the cinema and television, the print media, business and labor movements, women\u2019s movements, human rights groups, non-governmental organizations both indigenous and foreign, the activities of religious groups, environmental concerns, cultural and educational enterprises, and, very significantly, the project of nationalism itself as nurtured by groups belonging to civil society as it merges with the political sphere.\n\nThe nature of civil society in India, along with the other Top Things, seems to justify the conclusion that democracy in India is firmly established and that India will be both a free country and a great one in the twenty-first century.\n\n### Share this:\n\n*   [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century/?share=linkedin)\n*   [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century/?share=facebook)\n*   [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century/?share=twitter)\n*   [Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Pinterest](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/top-ten-things-to-know-about-india-in-the-twenty-first-century/?share=pinterest)\n\n### NOTES\n\n1.
