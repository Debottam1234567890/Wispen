It powers autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical conditions based on images.\n\nWhen companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning \u2014so much so that the terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\n\n\u201cIn just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of AI are done,\u201d said MIT Sloan professor Thomas W. Malone, the founding director of the [MIT Center for Collective Intelligence](https://cci.mit.edu/). \u201cSo that's why some people use the terms AI and machine learning almost as synonymous \u2026 most of the current advances in AI have involved machine learning.\u201d\n\nAI at Work Research and insights powering the intersection of AI and business, delivered monthly. \n\n- [x] \n\nYes, I\u2019d also like to subscribe to the Thinking Forward newsletter \n\nEmail \n\nLeave this field blank \n\nWith the growing ubiquity of machine learning, everyone in business is likely to encounter it and will need some working knowledge about this field. A 2020 Deloitte survey found that 67% of companies are using machine learning, and 97% are using or planning to use it in the next year.\n\nFrom manufacturing to retail and banking to bakeries, even legacy companies are using machine learning to unlock new value or boost efficiency. \u201cMachine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations,\u201d said MIT computer science professor [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/), director of the [MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/center-deployable-machine-learning-cdml).\n\nWhile not everyone needs to know the technical details, they should understand what the technology does and what it can and cannot do, Madry added. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can afford not to be aware of what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThat includes being aware of the social, societal, and ethical implications of machine learning. \u201cIt's important to engage and begin to understand these tools, and then think about how you're going to use them well. We have to use these [tools] for the good of everybody,\u201d said [Dr. Joan LaRovere](https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/physicians/l/joan-larovere), MBA \u201916, a pediatric cardiac intensive care physician and co-founder of the nonprofit The Virtue Foundation. \u201cAI has so much potential to do good, and we need to really keep that in our lenses as we're thinking about this. How do we use this to do good and better the world?\u201d\n\n**What is machine learning?**\n-----------------------------\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.\n\nThe goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit \u201cintelligent behaviors\u201d like humans, according to [Boris Katz](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/boris-katz), a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world.\n\nMachine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) as \u201cthe field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\u201d\n\nThe definition holds true, according to Mikey Shulman, a lecturer at MIT Sloan and head of machine learning at[Kensho](https://www.kensho.com/), which specializes in artificial intelligence for the finance and U.S. intelligence communities. He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or \u201csoftware 1.0,\u201d to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time. Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow.\n\nBut in some cases, writing a program for the machine to follow is time-consuming or impossible, such as training a computer to recognize pictures of different people. While humans can do this task easily, it\u2019s difficult to tell a computer how to do it. Machine learning takes the approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through experience.\n\nMachine learning starts with data \u2014 numbers, photos, or text, like bank transactions, pictures of people or even [bakery items](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-pastry-ai-that-learned-to-fight-cancer), repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports. The data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more data, the better the program.\n\nFrom there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or make predictions. Over time the human programmer can also tweak the model, including changing its parameters, to help push it toward more accurate results. (Research scientist Janelle Shane\u2019s website [AI Weirdness](https://aiweirdness.com/) is an entertaining look at how machine learning algorithms learn and how they can get things wrong \u2014as happened when [an algorithm tried to generate recipes](https://aiweirdness.com/post/190569291992/ai-recipes-are-bad-and-a-proposal-for-making-them) and created Chocolate Chicken Chicken Cake.)\n\nSome data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future with different sets of data.\n\nSuccessful machine learning algorithms can do different things, Malone wrote in a [recent research brief about AI and the future of work](https://workofthefuture-taskforce.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-Research-Brief-Malone-Rus-Laubacher2.pdf) that was co-authored by MIT professor and CSAIL director Daniela Rus and Robert Laubacher, the associate director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe function of a machine learning system can be **descriptive**, meaning that the system uses the data to explain what happened; **predictive**, meaning the system uses the data to predict what will happen; or **prescriptive**, meaning the system will use the data to make suggestions about what action to take,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThere are three subcategories of machine learning:\n\n**Supervised** machine learning models are trained with labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more accurate over time. For example, an algorithm would be trained with pictures of dogs and other things, all labeled by humans, and the machine would learn ways to identify pictures of dogs on its own. Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today.\n\nIn **unsupervised** machine learning, a program looks for patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find patterns or trends that people aren\u2019t explicitly looking for. For example, an unsupervised machine learning program could look through online sales data and identify different types of clients making purchases.\n\n**Reinforcement**machine learning trains machines through trial and error to take the best action by establishing a reward system. Reinforcement learning can train models to play games or train autonomous vehicles to drive by telling the machine when it made the right decisions, which helps it learn over time what actions it should take.\n\n![Image 4: Infographic entitled \"What do you want your machine learning system to do?\"](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/2_1_large_1050x525/public/2023-11/machine-learning-infographic.jpg?h=e9dd200c&itok=AdYPSlte)\n\nSource: Thomas Malone | MIT Sloan. See: https://bit.ly/3gvRho2, Figure 2.\n\nIn the Work of the Future brief, Malone noted that machine learning is best suited for situations with lots of data \u2014 thousands or millions of examples, like recordings from previous conversations with customers, sensor logs from machines, or ATM transactions. For example, Google Translate was possible because it \u201ctrained\u201d on the vast amount of information on the web, in different languages.\n\nIn some cases, machine learning can gain insight or automate decision-making in cases where humans would not be able to, Madry said. \u201cIt may not only be more efficient and less costly to have an algorithm do this, but sometimes humans just literally are not able to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle search is an example of something that humans can do, but never at the scale and speed at which the Google models are able to show potential answers every time a person types in a query, Malone said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an example of computers putting people out of work. It's an example of computers doing things that would not have been remotely economically feasible if they had to be done by humans.\u201d\n\nMachine learning is also associated with several other artificial intelligence subfields:\n\n**Natural language processing**\n\nNatural language processing is a field of machine learning in which machines learn to understand natural language as spoken and written by humans, instead of the data and numbers normally used to program computers. This allows machines to recognize language, understand it, and respond to it, as well as create new text and translate between languages. Natural language processing enables familiar technology like chatbots and digital assistants like Siri or Alexa.\n\n**Neural networks**\n\n[Neural networks](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414) are a commonly used, specific class of machine learning algorithms. Artificial neural networks are modeled on the human brain, in which thousands or millions of processing nodes are interconnected and organized into layers.\n\nIn an artificial neural network, cells, or nodes, are connected, with each cell processing inputs and producing an output that is sent to other neurons. Labeled data moves through the nodes, or cells, with each cell performing a different function. In a neural network trained to identify whether a picture contains a cat or not, the different nodes would assess the information and arrive at an output that indicates whether a picture features a cat.\n\n**Deep learning**\n\nDeep learning networks are neural networks with many layers. The layered network can process extensive amounts of data and determine the \u201cweight\u201d of each link in the network \u2014for example, in an image recognition system, some layers of the neural network might detect individual features of a face, like eyes, nose, or mouth, while another layer would be able to tell whether those features appear in a way that indicates a face.\n\nLike neural networks, deep learning is modeled on the way the human brain works and powers many machine learning uses, like autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and medical diagnostics.\n\n\u201cThe more layers you have, the more potential you have for doing complex things well,\u201d Malone said.\n\nDeep learning requires a great deal of computing power, which raises [concerns about its economic and environmental](https://ide.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RBN.Thompson.pdf) sustainability.\n\n**How businesses are using machine learning**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nMachine learning is the core of some companies\u2019 business models, like in the case of [Netflix\u2019s suggestions](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/machine-learning) algorithm or [Google\u2019s search engine](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/). Other companies are engaging deeply with machine learning, though it\u2019s not their main business proposition.\n\nOthers are still trying to determine how to use machine learning in a beneficial way. \u201cIn my opinion, one of the hardest problems in machine learning is figuring out what problems I can solve with machine learning,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a gap in the understanding.\u201d\n\n[![Image 5: A person in business attire holding a maestro baton orchestrating data imagery in the background](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/promo_desktop/public/2024-10/pdf-ad-cropped.jpg?h=ecfff384&itok=gCZkGyik) ### Leading the AI-Driven Organization In person at MIT Sloan Register Now ![Image 6: MIT Sloan Executive Education logo](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/promo_logo/public/2024-08/MITSloanLogo_ExecutiveEducation_Horizontal_WHITE_web.png?itok=4jhLFWqQ)](https://executive.mit.edu/course/leading-the-ai-driven-organization/a054v00000r9U5cAAE.html?utm_source=ideasmadetomatter&utm_medium=web-displayad&utm_campaign=LAI)\nIn a [2018 paper](https://ide.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-08-MITIDE-researchbrief-Erikb.final_.pdf), researchers from the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy outlined a 21-question rubric to determine whether a task is suitable for machine learning. The researchers found that no occupation will be untouched by machine learning, but no occupation is likely to be completely taken over by it. The way to unleash machine learning success, the researchers found, was to reorganize jobs into discrete tasks, some which can be done by machine learning, and others that require a human.\n\nCompanies are already using machine learning in several ways, including:\n\n**Recommendation algorithms.** The [recommendation engines](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIf4uK7lAf6/) behind Netflix and YouTube suggestions, what information appears on your Facebook feed, and [product recommendations](https://news.mit.edu/2020/armoire-fashion-rental-1124) are fueled by machine learning. \u201c[The algorithms] are trying to learn our preferences,\u201d Madry said. \u201cThey want to learn, like on Twitter, what tweets we want them to show us, on Facebook, what ads to display, what posts or liked content to share with us.\u201d\n\n**Image analysis and object detection.** Machine learning can analyze images for different information, like learning to identify people and tell them apart \u2014though [facial recognition algorithms are controversial.](https://www.media.mit.edu/articles/bias-in-facial-recognition-isn-t-hard-to-discover-but-it-s-hard-to-get-rid-of/) Business uses for this vary. Shulman noted that hedge funds famously use [machine learning to analyze the number of cars](https://medium.com/geoai/parking-lot-vehicle-detection-using-deep-learning-49597917bc4a)in parking lots, which helps them learn how companies are performing and make good bets.\n\n**Fraud detection**. Machines can analyze patterns, like how someone normally spends or where they normally shop, to [identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions](https://news.mit.edu/2018/machine-learning-financial-credit-card-fraud-0920), log-in attempts, or spam emails.\n\n**Automatic helplines or chatbots.** Many companies are deploying online chatbots, in which customers or clients don\u2019t speak to humans, but instead interact with a machine. These algorithms use machine learning and natural language processing, with the bots learning from records of past conversations to come up with appropriate responses.\n\n**Self-driving cars.** Much of the technology behind self-driving cars is based on machine learning, [deep learning in particular](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/how-driveai-is-mastering-autonomous-driving-with-deep-learning).\n\n**Medical imaging and diagnostics.**Machine learning programs can be trained to [examine medical images or other information](https://www.pathai.com/) and look for certain markers of illness, like a tool that can [predict cancer risk](https://news.mit.edu/2021/robust-artificial-intelligence-tools-predict-future-cancer-0128) based on a mammogram.\n\n[Read report: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work](https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-Research-Brief-Malone-Rus-Laubacher2.pdf)\n\n**How machine learning works: promises and challenges**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile machine learning is fueling technology that can help workers or open new possibilities for businesses, there are several things business leaders should know about machine learning and its limits.\n\n**Explainability**\n\nOne area of concern is what some experts call explainability, or the ability to be clear about what the machine learning models are doing and how they make decisions. \u201cUnderstanding why a model does what it does is actually a very difficult question, and you always have to ask yourself that,\u201d Madry said. \u201cYou should never treat this as a black box, that just comes as an oracle \u2026 yes, you should use it, but then try to get a feeling of what are the rules of thumb that it came up with? And then validate them.\u201d\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[What business leaders need to know about AI](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/what-business-leaders-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence \"What business leaders need to know about AI \")[7 lessons for successful machine learning projects](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/7-lessons-to-ensure-successful-machine-learning-projects \"7 lessons for successful machine learning projects \")[Why finance is deploying natural language processing](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/why-finance-deploying-natural-language-processing \"Why finance is deploying natural language processing\")\n\nThis is especially important because systems can be fooled and undermined, or just fail on certain tasks, even those humans can perform easily. For example, adjusting the metadata in images can confuse computers \u2014with a few adjustments, a machine [identifies a picture of a dog as an ostrich](https://www.popsci.com/byzantine-science-deceiving-artificial-intelligence/).\n\nMadry pointed out another example in which a machine learning algorithm examining X-rays seemed to outperform physicians. But it turned out the algorithm was correlating results with the machines that took the image, not necessarily the image itself. Tuberculosis is more common in developing countries, which tend to have older machines. The machine learning program learned that if the X-ray was taken on an older machine, the patient was more likely to have tuberculosis. It completed the task, but not in the way the programmers intended or would find useful.\n\nThe importance of explaining how a model is working \u2014and its accuracy \u2014can vary depending on how it\u2019s being used, Shulman said. While most well-posed problems can be solved through machine learning, he said, people should assume right now that the models only perform to about 95% of human accuracy. It might be okay with the programmer and the viewer if an algorithm recommending movies is 95% accurate, but that level of accuracy wouldn\u2019t be enough for a self-driving vehicle or a program designed to find serious flaws in machinery.\n\n**Bias and unintended outcomes**\n\nMachines are trained by humans, and human biases can be incorporated into algorithms \u2014if biased information, or data that reflects existing inequities, is fed to a machine learning program, the program will learn to replicate it and perpetuate forms of discrimination. Chatbots trained on how people converse on Twitter can [pick up on offensive and racist language](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html), for example.\n\nIn some cases, machine learning models create or exacerbate social problems. For example, Facebook has used machine learning as a tool to show users ads and content that will interest and engage them \u2014which has led to [models showing people extreme content](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/) that leads to polarization and the spread of conspiracy theories when people are shown incendiary, partisan, or inaccurate content.\n\nWays to [fight against bias in machine learning](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-risk-of-machine-learning-bias-and-how-to-prevent-it/) including carefully vetting training data and putting [organizational support behind ethical artificial intelligence efforts,](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/putting-responsible-ai-into-practice/) like making sure your organization embraces [human-centered AI](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-can-human-centered-ai-fight-bias-machines-and-people), the practice of seeking input from people of different backgrounds, experiences, and lifestyles when designing AI systems. Initiatives working on this issue include the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/) and[The Moral Machine](https://www.moralmachine.net/)project.\n\n**Putting machine learning to work**\n------------------------------------\n\nShulman said executives tend to struggle with understanding where machine learning can actually add value to their company. What\u2019s gimmicky for one company is core to another, and businesses should avoid trends and find business use cases that work for them.\n\n> Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations.\n\n**Aleksander Madry**MIT Computer Science Professor\n\nShare\n\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=197866067790470&display=popup&href=https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained&redirect_uri=https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained&quote=Machine%20learning%20is%20changing,%20or%20will%20change,%20every%20industry,%20and%20leaders%20need%20to%20understand%20the%20basic%20principles,%20the%20potential,%20and%20the%20limitations. \"Share on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained&text=Machine%20learning%20is%20changing,%20or%20will%20change,%20every%20industry,%20and%20leaders%20need%20to%20understand%20the%20basic%20principles,%20the%20potential,%20and%20the%20limitations.&via=MITSloan \"Share on X\")\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained&title=Machine%20learning,%20explained%20&summary=Machine%20learning%20is%20changing,%20or%20will%20change,%20every%20industry,%20and%20leaders%20need%20to%20understand%20the%20basic%20principles,%20the%20potential,%20and%20the%20limitations.&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n*   [](mailto:?subject=Machine%20learning%2C%20explained%20&body=Machine%20learning%20is%20changing,%20or%20will%20change,%20every%20industry,%20and%20leaders%20need%20to%20understand%20the%20basic%20principles,%20the%20potential,%20and%20the%20limitations.%20https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloan.mit.edu%2Fideas-made-to-matter%2Fmachine-learning-explained \"Mail link\")\n\nThe way machine learning works for Amazon is probably not going to translate at a car company, Shulman said \u2014while Amazon has found success with voice assistants and voice-operated speakers, that doesn\u2019t mean car companies should prioritize adding speakers to cars. More likely, he said, the car company might find a way to use machine learning on the factory line that saves or makes a great deal of money.\n\n\u201cThe field is moving so quickly, and that's awesome, but it makes it hard for executives to make decisions about it and to decide how much resourcing to pour into it,\u201d Shulman said.\n\nIt\u2019s also best to avoid looking at machine learning as a solution in search of a problem, Shulman said. Some companies might end up trying to backport machine learning into a business use. Instead of starting with a focus on technology, [businesses should start with a focus on a business problem](https://executive.mit.edu/course/machine-learning-in-business/a056g00000URaaGAAT.html?utm_source=ideasmadetomatter&utm_medium=web) or customer need that could be met with machine learning.\n\nA basic understanding of machine learning is important, LaRovere said, but finding the right machine learning use ultimately rests on people with different expertise working together. \u201cI'm not a data scientist. I'm not doing the actual data engineering work \u2014 all the data acquisition, processing, and wrangling to enable machine learning applications\u2014 but I understand it well enough to be able to work with those teams to get the answers we need and have the impact we need,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really have to work in a team.\u201d\n\nLearn more:\n-----------\n\nSign-up for a[Machine Learning in Business Course](https://executive.mit.edu/course/machine-learning-in-business/a056g00000URaaGAAT.html?utm_source=ideasmadetomatter&utm_medium=web).\n\nWatch an[Introduction to Machine Learning through MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-036-introduction-to-machine-learning-fall-2020/).\n\nRead about how[an AI pioneer thinks companies can use machine learning to transform](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021258/ai-pioneer-andrew-ng-machine-learning-business/).\n\nWatch a discussion with two AI experts about[machine learning strides and limitations](https://ide.mit.edu/insights/machine-learning-strides-and-limitations-a-conversation-with-andrew-mcafee-hilary-mason-and-claudia-perlich/).\n\nTake a look at[the seven steps of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW8Ndu7Mjw).\n\n[Read next: 7 lessons for successful machine learning projects](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/7-lessons-to-ensure-successful-machine-learning-projects)\n\nFor more info Sara Brown Senior News Editor and Writer [sbrown1@mit.edu](mailto:sbrown1@mit.edu \"email at sbrown1@mit.edu\")\n\nRelated **Articles**\n--------------------\n\n[![Image 7: Various boxes with the acronym \"AI\" and the numbers \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3.\"](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/multi_up_large_desktop/public/2025-11/ai-blocks_1.jpg?h=517d30df&itok=pyA_lL0c)**Ideas Made to Matter**Use these 3 MIT guides when implementing AI in your organization](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/use-these-3-mit-guides-when-implementing-ai-your-organization \"Use these 3 MIT guides when implementing AI in your organization\")[![Image 8: A robot holds a magnifying glass over customer reviews](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/multi_up_small_desktop/public/2025-11/robot-magnifying-glass-reviews2.jpg?h=9a162b51&itok=9rDBGk5k)**Ideas Made to Matter**Large language models can help professionals identify customer needs](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/large-language-models-can-help-professionals-identify-customer-needs \"Large language models can help professionals identify customer needs\")[![Image 9: A circuit board in the shape of a brain is covered with microchips with images of a bank, gps points, and a dragon](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/multi_up_medium_desktop/public/2025-11/ai-brain_3.jpg?h=fcf9bc07&itok=aUYYf8j5)**Ideas Made to Matter**AI\u2019s missing ingredient: Shared wisdom](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/ais-missing-ingredient-shared-wisdom \"AI\u2019s missing ingredient: Shared wisdom\")\n\nThe Mission\n-----------\n\nThe mission of the MIT Sloan School of Management is to develop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world and to generate ideas that advance management practice.\n\nFind Us\n-------\n\n[**MIT Sloan School of Management**100 Main Street Cambridge, MA 02142](https://www.google.com/maps/place/MIT+Sloan+School+of+Management/@42.3610109,-71.085189,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e370a66efa6057:0x9bcd706c8ad3aa7a!8m2!3d42.361007!4d-71.082995 \"Map of MIT Campus -

(**ML**) is a [field of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_study \"Field of study\") in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial

[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data \"Data\") and [generalise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalise \"Generalise\") to unseen data, and thus perform [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(computing) \"Task (computing)\") without explicit [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code \"Machine

learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") have allowed [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning) \"Neural network (machine

processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\"), [email filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering \"Email filtering\"), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture \"Agriculture\"), and [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine \"Medicine\"). The application of ML to business problems is known as [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics \"Predictive analytics\").\n\n[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\") and [mathematical optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimisation \"Mathematical optimisation\") (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\") is a related field of study, focusing on [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis \"Exploratory data analysis\") (EDA) via [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Friedman-1998-4)\n\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, [probably approximately correct learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning \"Probably approximately correct learning\") provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as [empirical risk minimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimisation \"Empirical risk minimisation\") under this framework.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nSee also: [Timeline of machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_machine_learning \"Timeline of machine learning\")\n\nThe term _machine learning_ was coined in 1959 by [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) \"Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)\"), an [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") employee and pioneer in the field of [computer gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_gaming \"Computer gaming\") and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Samuel-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Kohavi-6) The synonym _self-teaching computers_ was also used in this time period.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-cyberthreat-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-8)\n\nThe earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) \"Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)\") invented a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program \"Computer program\") that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-WhatIs-9) In 1949, [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians \"Canadians\") psychologist [Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb \"Donald O. Hebb\") published the book _[The Organization of Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization\\_of\\_Behavior \"Organization of Behavior\")_, in which he introduced a [theoretical neural structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory \"Hebbian theory\") formed by certain interactions among [nerve cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_cells \"Nerve cells\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-10)[Hebb's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebb%27s_model \"Hebb's model\") of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or [artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron \"Artificial neuron\") used by computers to communicate data.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-WhatIs-9) Other researchers who have studied human [cognitive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_systems_engineering \"Cognitive systems engineering\") contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts \"Walter Pitts\") and [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch \"Warren Sturgis McCulloch\"), who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm \"Algorithm\") that mirror human thought processes.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-WhatIs-9)\n\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with [punched tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape \"Punched tape\") memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by [Raytheon Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_Company \"Raytheon Company\") to analyse [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar \"Sonar\") signals, [electrocardiograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography \"Electrocardiography\"), and speech patterns using rudimentary [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"). It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"[goof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goof \"Goof\")\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-11) A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was [Nils Nilsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson \"Nils John Nilsson\")'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-12) Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-13) In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\") learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-14)\n\n[Tom M. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell \"Tom M. Mitchell\") provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience _E_ with respect to some class of tasks _T_ and performance measure _P_ if its performance at tasks in _T_, as measured by _P_, improves with experience _E_.\"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Mitchell-1997-15) This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally [operational definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition \"Operational definition\") rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\")'s proposal in his paper \"[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\")\", in which the question, \"Can machines think?\", is replaced with the question, \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-16)\n\nModern-day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithm types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-17)\n\n*   Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression.\n*   Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule.\n*   Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model-based methods or model-free methods.\n\nIn 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-18) By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-19)\n\nRelationships to other fields\n-----------------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Relationships to other fields\")]\n\n### Artificial intelligence\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Artificial intelligence\")]\n\n[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg/250px-AI_hierarchy.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AI_hierarchy.svg)\n\n[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-journalimcms.org-20)\n\nAs a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") (AI). In the early days of AI as an [academic discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(academia) \"Discipline (academia)\"), some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"[neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\")\"; these were mostly [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron \"Perceptron\") and [other models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE \"ADALINE\") that were later found to be reinventions of the [generalised linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_linear_model \"Generalised linear model\") of statistics.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-21)[Probabilistic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_reasoning \"Probabilistic reasoning\") was also employed, especially in [automated medical diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_medical_diagnosis \"Automated medical diagnosis\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-aima-22): 488\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the [logical, knowledge-based approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI \"Symbolic AI\") caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-aima-22): 488  By 1980, [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system \"Expert system\") had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-changing-23) Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to [inductive logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming \"Inductive logic programming\")(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition \"Pattern recognition\") and [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval \"Information retrieval\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-aima-22): 708\u2013710, 755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\") around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"[connectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism \"Connectionism\")\", by researchers from other disciplines, including [John Hopfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopfield \"John Hopfield\"), [David Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart \"David Rumelhart\"), and [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton \"Geoffrey Hinton\"). Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation \"Backpropagation\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-aima-22): 25\n\nMachine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the [symbolic approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence \"Symbolic artificial intelligence\") it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\"), and [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory \"Probability theory\").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-changing-23)\n\n### Data compression\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Data compression\")]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from [Data compression \u00a7 Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Machine_learning \"Data compression\").[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_compression&action=edit)]\n\nThere is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the [posterior probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probabilities \"Posterior probabilities\") of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [arithmetic coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding \"Arithmetic coding\") on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Data_compression_Mahoney-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Data_compression_Market_Efficiency-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Data_compression_Ben-Gal-26)\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [feature space vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_space_vector \"Feature space vector\"), and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Data_compression_ScullyBrodley-27)\n\nAccording to [AIXI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI \"AIXI\") theory, a connection more directly explained in [Hutter Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize \"Hutter Prize\"), the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n\nExamples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include [NVIDIA Maxine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Maxine \"NVIDIA Maxine\"), AIVC.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-28) Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV \"OpenCV\"), [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow \"TensorFlow\"), [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB \"MATLAB\")'s Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-29)\n\nIn [unsupervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_machine_learning \"Unsupervised machine learning\"), [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering \"K-means clustering\") can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as [image compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression \"Image compression\").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-30)\n\nData compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid \"Centroid\") of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing \"Image processing\") and [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing \"Signal processing\"), k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-31)\n\n[Large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model \"Large language model\") (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind \"DeepMind\")'s research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as [Portable Network Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics \"Portable Network Graphics\") (PNG) for images and [Free Lossless Audio Codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec \"Free Lossless Audio Codec\") (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-33)\n\n### Data mining\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Data mining\")]\n\nMachine learning and [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\") often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on _known_ properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation) \"Discovery (observation)\") of (previously) _unknown_ properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [knowledge discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_discovery \"Knowledge discovery\") in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"[unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\")\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [ECML PKDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECML_PKDD \"ECML PKDD\") being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to _reproduce known_ knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously _unknown_ knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimisation \"Optimisation\"): Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some [loss function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function \"Loss function\") on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a [label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeled_data \"Labeled data\") to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-34)\n\n### Generalization\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Generalization\")]\n\nCharacterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") algorithms.\n\n### Statistics\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Statistics\")]\n\nMachine learning and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\") are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference \"Statistical inference\") from a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics) \"Sample (statistics)\"), while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-35)\n\nConventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-36)\n\n[Leo Breiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman \"Leo Breiman\") distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Cornell-University-Library-2001-37) wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest \"Random forest\").\n\nSome statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call _statistical learning_.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-islr-38)\n\n### Statistical physics\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Statistical physics\")]\n\nAnalytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_neural_network \"Deep neural network\").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-SP_1-39) Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of [medical diagnostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnostics \"Medical diagnostics\").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-SP_2-40)\n\nTheory\n------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Theory\")]\n\nMain articles: [Computational learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory \"Computational learning theory\") and [Statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory \"Statistical learning theory\")\n\nA core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-bishop2006-2)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Mohri-2012-41) Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science \"Theoretical computer science\") known as [computational learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory \"Computational learning theory\") via the [probably approximately correct learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning \"Probably approximately correct learning\") model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [bias\u2013variance decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_decomposition \"Bias\u2013variance decomposition\") is one way to quantify generalisation [error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals \"Errors and residuals\").\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting \"Overfitting\") and generalisation will be poorer.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-alpaydin-42)\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time \"Time complexity\"). There are two kinds of [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity \"Time complexity\") results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n\nApproaches\n----------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Approaches\")]\n\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png/330px-Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png)\n\nIn [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"), the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\"), the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\n\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n\n*   [Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"): The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) \"Map (mathematics)\") inputs to outputs.\n*   [Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\"): No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ([feature learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning \"Feature learning\")).\n*   [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"): A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as [driving a vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car \"Autonomous car\") or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-bishop2006-2)\n\nAlthough each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-45)\n\n### Supervised learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Supervised learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\")\n\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Svm_max_sep_hyperplane_with_margin.png/250px-Svm_max_sep_hyperplane_with_margin.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Svm_max_sep_hyperplane_with_margin.png)\n\nA [support-vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine \"Support-vector machine\") is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a [linear boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier \"Linear classifier\"). Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.\n\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-46) The data, known as [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data \"Training data\"), consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure \"Array data structure\") or vector, sometimes called a [feature vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector \"Feature vector\"), and the training data is represented by a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) \"Matrix (mathematics)\"). Through [iterative optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization#Computational_optimization_techniques \"Mathematical optimization\") of an [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function \"Loss function\"), supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-47) An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Mitchell-1997-15)\n\nTypes of supervised-learning algorithms include [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning) \"Active learning (machine learning)\"), [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification \"Statistical classification\") and [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis \"Regression analysis\").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Alpaydin-2010-48) Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-49)\n\n[Similarity learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning \"Similarity learning\") is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in [ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking \"Ranking\"), [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system \"Recommender system\"), visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\n\n### Unsupervised learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Unsupervised learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\")\n\nSee also: [Cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis \"Cluster analysis\")\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction \"Dimensionality reduction\"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Friedman-1998-4) and [density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation \"Density estimation\").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-JordanBishop2004-50)\n\nCluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called _clusters_) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some _similarity metric_ and evaluated, for example, by _internal compactness_, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and _separation_, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on _estimated density_ and _graph connectivity_.\n\nA special type of unsupervised learning called, [self-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning \"Self-supervised learning\") involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-52)\n\n### Semi-supervised learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Semi-supervised learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Semi-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning \"Semi-supervised learning\")\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\") (without any labelled training data) and [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\") (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.\n\nIn [weakly supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision \"Weak supervision\"), the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-53)\n\n### Reinforcement learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Reinforcement learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\")\n\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Reinforcement_learning_diagram.svg/250px-Reinforcement_learning_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reinforcement_learning_diagram.svg)\n\nIn reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward and/or a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent.\n\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how [software agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent \"Software agent\") ought to take [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_selection \"Action selection\") in an environment to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory \"Game theory\"), [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory \"Control theory\"), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research \"Operations research\"), [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory \"Information theory\"), [simulation-based optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation-based_optimisation \"Simulation-based optimisation\"), [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system \"Multi-agent system\"), [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence \"Swarm intelligence\"), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\") and [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm \"Genetic algorithm\"). In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process \"Markov decision process\") (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming \"Dynamic programming\") techniques.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-54) Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\n\n### Dimensionality reduction\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Dimensionality reduction\")]\n\n[Dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction \"Dimensionality reduction\") is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-55) In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the [feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning) \"Feature (machine learning)\") set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or [extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction \"Feature extraction\"). One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis \"Principal component analysis\") (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The [manifold hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_hypothesis \"Manifold hypothesis\") proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold \"Manifold\"), and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the areas of [manifold learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_learning \"Manifold learning\") and [manifold regularisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_regularisation \"Manifold regularisation\").\n\n### Other types\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Other types\")]\n\nOther approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model \"Topic model\"), [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-learning_(computer_science) \"Meta-learning (computer science)\").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-56)\n\n#### Self-learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Self-learning\")]\n\nSelf-learning, as a machine learning paradigm, was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named _crossbar adaptive array_ (CAA).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-58) It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as a state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-59) The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n\n1.   in situation _s_ act _a_\n2.   receive a consequence situation _s_'\n3.   compute emotion of being in the consequence situation _v(s')_\n4.   update crossbar memory _w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')_\n\nIt is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-60)\n\n#### Feature learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Feature learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Feature learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning \"Feature learning\")\n\nSeveral learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-pami-61) Classic examples include [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis \"Principal component analysis\") and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering \"Feature engineering\"), and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\"), [multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron \"Multilayer perceptron\"), and supervised [dictionary learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_learning \"Dictionary learning\"). In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, [independent component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis \"Independent component analysis\"), [autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder \"Autoencoder\"), [matrix factorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition \"Matrix decomposition\")[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-62) and various forms of [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis \"Cluster analysis\").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-coates2011-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-jurafsky-65)\n\n[Manifold learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_learning \"Manifold learning\") algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. [Sparse coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_coding \"Sparse coding\") algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. [Multilinear subspace learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_subspace_learning \"Multilinear subspace learning\") algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor \"Tensor\") representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-66)[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-67)\n\nFeature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data have not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n\n#### Sparse dictionary learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Sparse dictionary learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Sparse dictionary learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_dictionary_learning \"Sparse dictionary learning\")\n\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of [basis functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function \"Basis function\") and assumed to be a [sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix \"Sparse matrix\"). The method is [strongly NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_NP-hard \"Strongly NP-hard\") and difficult to solve approximately.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-68) A popular [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic \"Heuristic\") method for sparse dictionary learning is the [_k_-SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-SVD \"K-SVD\") algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in [image denoising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_denoising \"Image denoising\"). The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-69)\n\n#### Anomaly detection\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Anomaly detection\")]\n\nMain article: [Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection \"Anomaly detection\")\n\nIn [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\"), anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Zimek-2017-70) Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as [bank fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud \"Bank fraud\"), a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as [outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier \"Outlier\"), novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-71)\n\nIn particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-72)\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-ChandolaSurvey-73) Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance being generated by the model.\n\n#### Robot learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Robot learning\")]\n\n[Robot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_learning \"Robot learning\") is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-75) and finally [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-learning_(computer_science) \"Meta-learning (computer science)\") (e.g. MAML).\n\n#### Association rules\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Association rules\")]\n\nMain article: [Association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning \"Association rule learning\")\n\nSee also: [Inductive logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming \"Inductive logic programming\")\n\nAssociation rule learning is a [rule-based machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_machine_learning \"Rule-based machine learning\") method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-piatetsky-76)\n\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-77) Rule-based machine learning approaches include [learning classifier systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system \"Learning classifier system\"), association rule learning, and [artificial immune systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_immune_system \"Artificial immune system\").\n\nBased on the concept of strong rules, [Rakesh Agrawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Agrawal_(computer_scientist) \"Rakesh Agrawal (computer scientist)\"), [Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Imieli%C5%84ski \"Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski\") and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by [point-of-sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-sale \"Point-of-sale\") (POS) systems in supermarkets.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-mining-78) For example, the rule {o n i o n s,p o t a t o e s}\u21d2{b u r g e r}{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}![Image 9: {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2e6daa2c8e553e87e411d6e0ec66ae596c3c9381) found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional [pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing \"Pricing\") or [product placements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement \"Product placement\"). In addition to [market basket analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket_analysis \"Market basket analysis\"), association rules are employed today in application areas including [Web usage mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_usage_mining \"Web usage mining\"), [intrusion detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection \"Intrusion detection\"), [continuous production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_production \"Continuous production\"), and [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics \"Bioinformatics\"). In contrast with [sequence mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_mining \"Sequence mining\"), association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\n[Learning classifier systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system \"Learning classifier system\") (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm \"Genetic algorithm\"), with a learning component, performing either [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"), or [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\"). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a [piecewise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise \"Piecewise\") manner to make predictions.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-79)\n\n[Inductive logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming \"Inductive logic programming\") (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming \"Logic programming\") as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that [entails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment \"Entailment\") all positive and no negative examples. [Inductive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_programming \"Inductive programming\") is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as [functional programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming \"Functional programming\").\n\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics \"Bioinformatics\") and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"). [Gordon Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Plotkin \"Gordon Plotkin\") and [Ehud Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Shapiro \"Ehud Shapiro\") laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-80)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-82) Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-83) The term _inductive_ here refers to [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction \"Mathematical induction\"), proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.\n\nModels\n------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Models\")]\n\nA **machine learning model** is a type of [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model \"Mathematical model\") that, once \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-84) By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-85)\n\nVarious types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called [model selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection \"Model selection\").\n\n### Artificial neural networks\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: Artificial neural networks\")]\n\nMain article: [Artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\")\n\nSee also: [Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\")\n\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg/250px-Colored_neural_network.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colored_neural_network.svg)\n\nAn artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") in a [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain \"Brain\"). Here, each circular node represents an [artificial neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron \"Artificial neuron\") and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [connectionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism \"Connectionism\") systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [biological neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network \"Biological neural network\") that constitute animal [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain \"Brain\"). Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron \"Artificial neuron\")\", which loosely model the [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") in a biological brain. Each connection, like the [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse \"Synapse\") in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number \"Real number\"), and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_(mathematics) \"Weight (mathematics)\") that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\") would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology \"Biology\"). Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\"), [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation \"Machine translation\"), [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network \"Social network\") filtering, [playing board and video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing \"General game playing\") and [medical diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis \"Medical diagnosis\").\n\n[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-86)\n\n### Decision trees\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Decision trees\")]\n\nMain article: [Decision tree learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning \"Decision tree learning\")\n\n[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Decision_Tree.jpg/330px-Decision_Tree.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Decision_Tree.jpg)\n\nA decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic \"Titanic\")\n\nDecision tree learning uses a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree \"Decision tree\") as a [predictive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modeling \"Predictive modeling\") to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_node \"Leaf node\") represent class labels, and branches represent [conjunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction \"Logical conjunction\") of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers \"Real numbers\")) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making \"Decision making\"). In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\n\n### Random forest regression\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Random forest regression\")]\n\n[Random forest regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest \"Random forest\") (RFR) falls under the umbrella of decision [tree-based models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-based_models \"Tree-based models\"). RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling; for instance, each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables the model to reduce biased predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single-output data as well as multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be use in various applications.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-87)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-88)\n\n### Support-vector machines\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit section: Support-vector machines\")]\n\nMain article: [Support-vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine \"Support-vector machine\")\n\nSupport-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\") methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-CorinnaCortes-89) An SVM training algorithm is a non-[probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_classification \"Probabilistic classification\"), [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classifier \"Binary classifier\"), [linear classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier \"Linear classifier\"), although methods such as [Platt scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platt_scaling \"Platt scaling\") exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_trick \"Kernel trick\"), implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n### Regression analysis\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=28 \"Edit section: Regression analysis\")]\n\nMain article: [Regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis \"Regression analysis\")\n\n[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/330px-Linear_regression.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linear_regression.svg)\n\nIllustration of linear regression on a data set\n\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression \"Linear regression\"), where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares \"Ordinary least squares\"). The latter is often extended by [regularisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics) \"Regularization (mathematics)\") methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression \"Ridge regression\"). When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression \"Polynomial regression\") (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-90)), [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression \"Logistic regression\") (often used in [statistical classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification \"Statistical classification\")) or even [kernel regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression \"Kernel regression\"), which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_trick \"Kernel trick\") to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n\n[Multivariate linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model \"General linear model\") extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a [multidimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_system \"Multidimensional system\") linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-91) which are inherently multi-dimensional.\n\n### Bayesian networks\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=29 \"Edit section: Bayesian networks\")]\n\nMain article: [Bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network \"Bayesian network\")\n\n[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg/250px-SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg)\n\nA simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [graphical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model \"Graphical model\") that represents a set of [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variables \"Random variables\") and their [conditional independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence \"Conditional independence\") with a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph \"Directed acyclic graph\") (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference \"Bayesian inference\") and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [speech signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\") or [protein sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence \"Peptide sequence\"), are called [dynamic Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Bayesian_network \"Dynamic Bayesian network\"). Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [influence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_diagram \"Influence diagram\").\n\n### Gaussian processes\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=30 \"Edit section: Gaussian processes\")]\n\nMain article: [Gaussian processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_processes \"Gaussian processes\")\n\n[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Regressions_sine_demo.svg/250px-Regressions_sine_demo.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Regressions_sine_demo.svg)\n\nAn example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-92)\n\nA Gaussian process is a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process \"Stochastic process\") in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a [multivariate normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution \"Multivariate normal distribution\"), and it relies on a pre-defined [covariance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_function \"Covariance function\"), or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.\n\nGiven a set of observed points, or input\u2013output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as a function of its input data can be directly computed by looking at the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.\n\nGaussian processes are popular surrogate models in [Bayesian optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimisation \"Bayesian optimisation\") used to do [hyperparameter optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimisation \"Hyperparameter optimisation\").\n\n### Genetic algorithms\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Genetic algorithms\")]\n\nMain article: [Genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm \"Genetic algorithm\")\n\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm \"Search algorithm\") and [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science) \"Heuristic (computer science)\") technique that mimics the process of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection \"Natural selection\"), using methods such as [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm) \"Mutation (genetic algorithm)\") and [crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm) \"Crossover (genetic algorithm)\") to generate new [genotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_(genetic_algorithm) \"Chromosome (genetic algorithm)\") in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-93)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-94) Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and [evolutionary algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm \"Evolutionary algorithm\").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-95)\n\n### Belief functions\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: Belief functions\")]\n\nMain article: [Dempster\u2013Shafer theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory \"Dempster\u2013Shafer theory\")\n\nThe theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster\u2013Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability \"Probability\"), [possibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibility_theory \"Possibility theory\") and [imprecise probability theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecise_probability \"Imprecise probability\"). These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a [pmf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function \"Probability mass function\")-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-96) However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches to incorporate ignorance and [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification \"Uncertainty quantification\"). These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various [ensemble methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_methods \"Ensemble methods\") to better handle the learner's [decision boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary \"Decision boundary\"), low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-YoosefzadehNajafabadi-2021-97)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Kohavi-6) However, the computational complexity of these algorithms is dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\n\n### Rule-based models\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Rule-based models\")]\n\nMain article: [Rule-based machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_machine_learning \"Rule-based machine learning\")\n\nRule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includes [learning classifier systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system \"Learning classifier system\"),[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-98)[association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning \"Association rule learning\"),[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-99)[artificial immune systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_immune_system \"Artificial immune system\"),[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-100) and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time.\n\n### Training models\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Training models\")]\n\nTypically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics) \"Sample (statistics)\") of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a [corpus of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_of_text \"Corpus of text\"), a collection of images, [sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor \"Sensor\") data, and data collected from individual users of a service. [Overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting \"Overfitting\") is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\") is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and, notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\n\n#### Federated learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Federated learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning \"Federated learning\")\n\nFederated learning is an adapted form of [distributed artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_artificial_intelligence \"Distributed artificial intelligence\") to train machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example, [Gboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gboard \"Gboard\") uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-101)\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=36

A joint team made up of researchers from [AT&T Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Labs \"AT&T Labs\")-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an [ensemble model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Averaging \"Ensemble Averaging\") to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-105) Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-106) In 2010, an article in _[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_ noted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis \"2008 financial crisis\").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-107) In 2012, co-founder of [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems \"Sun Microsystems\"), [Vinod Khosla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla \"Vinod Khosla\"), predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-108) In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-109) In 2019 [Springer Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Nature \"Springer Nature\") published the first research book created using machine learning.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-110) In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-111) Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-112) Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-113)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-114)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-115) When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting \"Overfitting\"). By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like [OLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares \"Ordinary least squares\").[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-116)\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-117)\n\nMachine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision-making in large-scale and small-scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-118)[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-119)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-120) Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-121)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-122)\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit section: Limitations\")]\n\nAlthough machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-123)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-124)[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-125) Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-126)\n\nThe \"[black box theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box \"Black box\")\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted from the data.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Babuta-2018-127) The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Babuta-2018-127)\n\nIn 2018, a self-driving car from [Uber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber \"Uber\") failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-128) Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the [IBM Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer) \"Watson (computer)\") system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-129)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-130) Microsoft's [Bing Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Chat \"Bing Chat\") chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-131)\n\nMachine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research itself.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-132)\n\n### Explainability\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit section: Explainability\")]\n\nMain article: [Explainable artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence \"Explainable artificial intelligence\")\n\nExplainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-133) It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-134) By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\n\n### Overfitting\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit section: Overfitting\")]\n\nMain article: [Overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting \"Overfitting\")\n\n[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Overfitted_Data.png/250px-Overfitted_Data.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overfitted_Data.png)\n\nThe blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.\n\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_6,_Chapter_7-135)\n\n### Other limitations and vulnerabilities\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit section: Other limitations and vulnerabilities\")]\n\nLearners can also be disappointed by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015286-136) A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-137)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-138)\n\nAdversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-TD_1-139) Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via [adversarial machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning \"Adversarial machine learning\").[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-140)\n\nResearchers have demonstrated how [backdoors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) \"Backdoor (computing)\") can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of [data/software transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_transparency \"Algorithmic transparency\") is provided, possibly including [white-box access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing \"White-box testing\").[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-141)[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-142)[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-143)\n\nModel assessments\n-----------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit section: Model assessments\")]\n\nClassification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the [holdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set \"Test set\") method, which splits the data into a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-[cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics) \"Cross-validation (statistics)\") method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics) \"Bootstrapping (statistics)\"), which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-144)\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report [sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity \"Sensitivity and specificity\"), meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR), respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [false positive rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_rate \"False positive rate\") (FPR) as well as the [false negative rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative_rate \"False negative rate\") (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. [Receiver operating characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic \"Receiver operating characteristic\") (ROC), along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-145)\n\nEthics\n------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit section: Ethics\")]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from [Ethics of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence \"Ethics of artificial intelligence\").[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit)]\n\nThe [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics \"Ethics\") of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence_Muller-2020-146) This includes [algorithmic biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\"), [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\"),[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-147)[automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\"),[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-148)[accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability \"Accountability\"), [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy \"Privacy\"), and [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence \"Regulation of artificial intelligence\"). It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as [machine ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_ethics \"Machine ethics\") (how to make machines that behave ethically), [lethal autonomous weapon systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon \"Lethal autonomous weapon\"), [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race \"Artificial intelligence arms race\") dynamics, [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety \"AI safety\") and [alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment \"AI alignment\"), [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment \"Technological unemployment\"), AI-enabled [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\"),[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence_:4-149) how to treat certain AI systems if they have a [moral status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_status \"Moral status\") (AI welfare and rights), [artificial superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_superintelligence \"Artificial superintelligence\") and [existential risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence \"Existential risk from artificial general intelligence\").[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence_Muller-2020-146)\n\n Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like [healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare \"Artificial intelligence in healthcare\"), education, criminal justice, or the military.\n\n### Bias\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=43 \"Edit section: Bias\")]\n\nMain article: [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\")\n\nDifferent machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Garcia-2016-150)\n\nSystems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-151) For example, in 1988, the UK's [Commission for Racial Equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Racial_Equality \"Commission for Racial Equality\") found that [St. George's Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George%27s,_University_of_London \"St George's, University of London\") had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European-sounding names.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Garcia-2016-150) Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Edionwe_Outline-152)[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Jeffries_Outline-153) Another example includes predictive policing company [Geolitica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolitica \"Geolitica\")'s predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Silva-2018-154)\n\nWhile responsible [collection of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection \"Data collection\") and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame the lack of participation and representation of minority populations in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-155) In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association in 2021, \"female faculty make up just 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Zhang-156) Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Zhang-156)\n\nLanguage models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-157)[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-158) Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language _[corpora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text\\_corpus \"Text corpus\")_ will necessarily also learn these biases.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-159)[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-160) In 2016, Microsoft tested [Tay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot) \"Tay (chatbot)\"), a [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot \"Chatbot\") that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-161)\n\nIn an experiment carried out by [ProPublica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica \"ProPublica\"), an [investigative journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism \"Investigative journalism\") organisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants\".[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-Silva-2018-154) In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-162) Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-163)\n\nBecause of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-164) Concern for [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\") in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including [Fei-Fei Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li \"Fei-Fei Li\"), who said that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and\u2014most importantly\u2014it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-165)\n\n### Financial incentives\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=44 \"Edit section: Financial incentives\")]\n\nThere are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States, where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals with an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-166)\n\nHardware\n--------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=45 \"Edit section: Hardware\")]\n\nSince the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_neural_network \"Deep neural network\") (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-167) By 2019, graphics processing units ([GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU \"GPU\")), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-168)[OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\") estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet \"AlexNet\") (2012) to [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero \"AlphaZero\") (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-169)[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-170)\n\n### Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit section: Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\")]\n\n[Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit \"Tensor Processing Unit\") are specialised hardware accelerators developed by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\") specifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose [GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit \"Graphics processing unit\") and [FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array \"Field-programmable gate array\"), TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-171) Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments.\n\n### Neuromorphic computing\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=47 \"Edit section: Neuromorphic computing\")]\n\n[Neuromorphic computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_computing \"Neuromorphic computing\") refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-172)\n\n#### Physical neural networks\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=48 \"Edit section: Physical neural networks\")]\n\nA [physical neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_neural_network \"Physical neural network\") is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of [neural synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse \"Chemical synapse\"). The term \"physical neural network\" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-173)[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-174)\n\n### Embedded machine learning\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&action=edit&section=49 \"Edit section: Embedded machine learning\")]\n\nEmbedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_systems \"Embedded systems\") with limited computing resources, such as [wearable computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_computer \"Wearable computer\"), [edge devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_device \"Edge device\") and [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontrollers \"Microcontrollers\").[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-175)[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-176)[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-177)[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-178) Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as [hardware acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration \"Hardware
