The field of quantum computing includes hardware research and application development. Quantum computers are able to solve certain types of problems faster than classical computers by taking advantage of quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and quantum interference. Some applications where quantum computers can provide such a speed boost include [machine learning (ML)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/), optimization, and simulation of physical systems. Eventual use cases could be portfolio optimization in finance or the simulation of chemical systems, solving problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers on the market.\n\n## What is the quantum computing advantage?\n\nCurrently, no quantum computer can perform a useful task faster, cheaper, or more efficiently than a classical computer. Quantum advantage is the threshold where we have built a quantum system that can perform operations that the best possible classical computer cannot simulate in any kind of reasonable time.\n\n## What is quantum mechanics?\n\nQuantum mechanics is the area of physics that studies the behavior of particles at a microscopic level. At subatomic levels, the equations that describe how particles behave is different from those that describe the macroscopic world around us. Quantum computers take advantage of these behaviors to perform computations in a completely new way.\n\n## What is a qubit?\n\nQuantum bits, or qubits, are represented by quantum particles. The manipulation of qubits by control devices is at the core of a quantum computer's processing power. Qubits in quantum computers are analogous to bits in classical computers. At its core, a classical machine's processor does all its work by manipulating bits. Similarly, the quantum processor does all its work by processing qubits.\n\n### **How are qubits different from classical bits?**\n\nIn classical computing, a bit is an electronic signal that is either on or off. The value of the classical bit can thus be one (on) or zero (off). However, because the qubit is based on the laws of quantum mechanics it can be placed in a superposition of states.\n\n## What are the principles of quantum computing?\n\nA quantum computer works using quantum principles. Quantum principles require a new dictionary of terms to be fully understood, terms that include superposition, entanglement, and decoherence. Let's understand these principles below.\n\n### Superposition\n\nSuperposition states that, much like waves in classical physics, you can add two or more quantum states and the result will be another valid quantum state. Conversely, you can also represent every quantum state as a sum of two or more other distinct states. This superposition of qubits gives quantum computers their inherent parallelism, allowing them to process millions of operations simultaneously.\n\n### Entanglement\n\nQuantum entanglement occurs when two systems link so closely that knowledge about one gives you immediate knowledge about the other, no matter how far apart they are. Quantum processors can draw conclusions about one particle by measuring another one. For example, they can determine that if one qubit spins upward, the other will always spin downward, and vice versa. Quantum entanglement allows quantum computers to solve complex problems faster.\n\nWhen a quantum state is measured, the wavefunction collapses and you measure the state as either a zero or a one. In this known or deterministic state, the qubit acts as a classical bit. Entanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits.\n\n### Decoherence\n\nDecoherence is the loss of the quantum state in a qubit. Environmental factors, like radiation, can cause the quantum state of the qubits to collapse. A large engineering challenge in constructing a quantum computer is designing the various features that attempt to delay decoherence of the state, such as building specialty structures that shield the qubits from external fields.\n\n## What are the components of a quantum computer?\n\nQuantum computers have hardware and software, similar to a classical computer.\n\n### **Quantum hardware**\n\nQuantum hardware has three main components.\n\n#### ****Quantum data plane****\n\nThe quantum data plane is the core of the quantum computer and includes the physical qubits and the structures required to hold them in place.\n\n#### ****Control and measurement plane****\n\nThe control and measurement plane converts digital signals into analog or wave control signals. These analog signals perform the operations on the qubits in the quantum data plane.\n\n#### ****Control processor plane and host processor****\n\nThe control processor plane implements the quantum algorithm or sequence of operations. The host processor interacts with the quantum software and provides a digital signal or classical bits sequence to the control and measurement plane.\n\n### **Quantum software**\n\nQuantum software implements unique quantum algorithms using quantum circuits. A quantum circuit is a computing routine that defines a series of logical quantum operations on the underlying qubits. Developers can use various software development tools and libraries to code quantum algorithms.\n\n## What are the types of quantum technology?\n\nNo one has shown the best way to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and multiple companies and research groups are investigating different types of qubits. We give a brief example of some of these qubit technologies below.\n\n### **Gate-based ion trap processors**\n\nA gate-based quantum computer is a device that takes input data and transforms it according to a predefined unitary operation. The operation is typically represented by a quantum circuit and is analogous to gate operations in traditional electronics. However, quantum gates are totally different from electronic gates.\n\nTrapped ion quantum computers implement qubits using electronic states of charged atoms called ions. The ions are confined and suspended above the microfabricated trap using electromagnetic fields. Trapped-ion based systems apply quantum gates using lasers to manipulate the electronic state of the ion. \u00a0Trapped ion qubits use atoms that come from nature, rather than manufacturing the qubits synthetically.\n\n### **Gate-based superconducting processors**\n\nSuperconductivity is a set of physical properties that you can observe in certain materials like mercury and helium at very low temperatures. In these materials, you can observe a characteristic critical temperature below which electrical resistance is zero and magnetic flux fields are expelled. An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.\n\nSuperconducting quantum computing is an implementation of a quantum computer in superconducting electronic circuits. Superconducting qubits are built with superconducting electric circuits that operate at cryogenic temperatures.\n\n### **Photonic processors**\n\nA quantum photonic processor is a device that manipulates light for computations. Photonic quantum computers use quantum light sources that emit squeezed-light pulses, with qubit equivalents that correspond to modes of a continuous operator, such as position or momentum.\n\n### **Neutral atom processors**\n\nNeutral atom qubit technology is similar to trapped ion technology. However, it uses light instead of electromagnetic forces to trap the qubit and hold it in position. The atoms are not charged and the circuits can operate at room temperatures\n\n### **Rydberg atom processors**\n\nA Rydberg atom is an excited atom with one or more electrons that are further away from the nucleus, on average. Rydberg atoms have a number of peculiar properties including an exaggerated response to electric and magnetic fields, and long life. When used as qubits, they offer strong and controllable atomic interactions that you can tune by selecting different states.\n\n### **Quantum annealers**\n\nQuantum annealing uses a physical process to place a quantum system's qubits in an absolute energy minimum. From there, the hardware gently alters the system's configuration so that its energy landscape reflects the problem that needs to be solved. The advantage of quantum annealers is that the number of qubits can be much larger than those available in a gate-based system. However, their use is limited to specific cases only.\n\n## How do companies use quantum computing?\n\nQuantum computing can revolutionize industries. We give some example use cases below:\n\n### **ML**\n\nMachine learning (ML) is the process of analyzing vast quantities of data to help computers make better predictions and decisions. Research in quantum computing studies the physical limits of information processing and is breaking new ground in fundamental physics. This research leads to advances in many fields of science and industry, such as chemistry, optimization, and molecular simulation. It is also a growing area of interest for financial services to predict market movements and for manufacturing to improve operations.\n\n### **Optimization**\n\nQuantum computing can improve research and development, supply-chain optimization, and production. For example, you could apply quantum computing to decrease manufacturing process\u2013related costs and shorten cycle times by optimizing elements such as path planning in complex processes. Another application is the quantum optimization of loan portfolios so that lenders can free up capital, lower interest rates, and improve their offerings.\n\n### **Simulation**\n\nThe computational effort required to simulate systems accurately scales exponentially with the complexity of drug molecules and materials. Even using approximation methods, current supercomputers cannot achieve the level of accuracy that these simulations demand. Quantum computation has the potential to solve some of the most challenging computational problems faced in chemistry, allowing the scientific community to do chemical simulations that are intractable today. For example, [Pasqal](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/quantum-chemistry-with-qucos-qubec-on-amazon-braket/) built their QUBEC computational software to run chemistry simulations. QUBEC automates the heavy lifting necessary to run quantum computational tasks from automatic provisioning of the computing infrastructure to running pre- and post-processing classical calculations and performing error mitigation tasks.\n\n## How can you get started with quantum computing?\n\nIf you want to try quantum computing, you can get started with a quantum hardware emulator on your local machine. Emulators are regular software that imitates quantum behavior on a classical computer. They are predictable and allow you to see quantum states. They are useful if you want to test your algorithms before investing in quantum hardware time. However, they cannot recreate real quantum behavior.\n\nYou can also use a cloud quantum computing service to code on a true quantum computer without investing in expensive hardware.\n\n## How can AWS help with quantum computing?\n\n[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is a fully managed quantum computing service. It is designed to help speed up scientific research and software development for quantum computing. You can use Amazon Braket to do these tasks:\n\n* Work with different types of quantum computers and circuit simulators using a consistent set of development tools.\n* Build quantum projects on a trusted cloud with straightforward pricing and management controls for both quantum and classical technology.\n* Innovate quickly with expert guidance and tech support, or collaborate with consultants in the [Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab](https://aws.amazon.com/quantum-solutions-lab/).\n* Push the boundaries of [quantum hardware research](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computing-research/?pg=ln&sec=uc) with access to trapped ion, superconducting, photonic, and annealing devices.\n\nGet started with quantum computing by creating an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/) today.\n\n## AWS Quantum Computing Next Steps\n\n[### Check out additional product-related resources\n\nLearn more about Quantum Computing Services](https://aws.amazon.com/braket)\n\n[### Sign up for a free account\n\nInstantly get access to the AWS free tier.\n\nSign up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html)\n\n[### Start building in the console\n\nGet started building with AWS in the AWS Management Console.\n\nSign in](https://console.aws.amazon.com)\n\n "

In reality a quantum computer leverages entanglement between qubits and the probabilities associated with superpositions to carry out a series of operations (a quantum algorithm) such that certain probabilities are enhanced (i.e., those of the right answers) and others depressed, even to zero (i.e., those of the wrong answers). When a measurement is made at the end of a computation, the probability of measuring the correct answer should be maximized.

They rely on qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for more complex computations and parallel processing. Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave. In this video, we have explained quantum computing in simple words and explained how quantum computers work.\n\n#QuantumComputing #FutureOfTech #QuantumSupremacy\n\nVideo link:\n\nQuantum entanglement explained: https://youtu.be/fkAAbXPEAtU?si=l5jUh0cCxj6jXDfE\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01692-9\nhttps://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/googles-claims-quantum-supremacy-groundbreaking-overhyped-or-both\nhttps://news.ucsb.edu/2019/019682/achieving-quantum-supremacy\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com\n\n484 comments\n### Transcript:\nA quantum computer is an advanced computer\u00a0\nthat uses the principles of quantum mechanics\u00a0\u00a0 to perform calculations at speeds unattainable by\u00a0\neven the top supercomputers of the modern world.\u00a0\u00a0 To understand how a quantum computer works,\u00a0\nimagine that you\u2019re playing a game of chess,\u00a0\u00a0 and want to predict all the possible moves\u00a0\nyour opponent might make. You can do this\u00a0\u00a0 with a classical or regular computer; it will\u00a0\ngo through each move of your opponent one at\u00a0\u00a0 a time until it runs through all possible\u00a0\nmoves. This process, as you can imagine,\u00a0\u00a0 can be time-consuming. However, if you had\u00a0\na quantum computer, it would simulate all\u00a0\u00a0 possible moves of your opponent at once, in a\u00a0\nfraction of the time the classical computer took. This is similar to what a quantum computer can\u00a0\ndo in the realm of analysis and computation. A quantum computer and a classical computer are\u00a0\nsimilar in some ways. Both have circuits, chips,\u00a0\u00a0 and logic gates to process information,\u00a0\nand they are both operated by algorithms. However, the primary difference lies in how\u00a0\nthey process information. Classical computers\u00a0\u00a0 use binary bits (0s and 1s), representing the\u00a0\non or off state of a current. Quantum computers,\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand, use qubits, which can exist\u00a0\nin both states simultaneously, a property known\u00a0\u00a0 as superposition. This unique ability of\u00a0\nqubits opens up a world of possibilities,\u00a0\u00a0 allowing quantum computers to process information\u00a0\nin a fundamentally different way than binary bits,\u00a0\u00a0 and potentially revolutionize\u00a0\nthe future of technology. Let\u2019s consider the concept of\u00a0\nsuperposition using an everyday example. When you flip a coin, it can show either heads or\u00a0\ntails, but when the coin is spinning in the air,\u00a0\u00a0 what state would you say the coin is in?\u00a0\nIs it heads, or is it tails? While it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 spinning in the air, it could be argued\u00a0\nthat it\u2019s both heads and tails, right? Similarly, a qubit can exist in both the 0 and\u00a0\n1 states simultaneously. In a quantum computer,\u00a0\u00a0 a system of multiple qubits can simultaneously\u00a0\npossess multiple states, allowing the quantum\u00a0\u00a0 computer to process many solutions simultaneously,\u00a0\nsomething a classical computer cannot do. This\u00a0\u00a0 capability enables quantum computers to solve\u00a0\nproblems much faster than classical computers. The magic of quantum computers doesn\u2019t\u00a0\nend with qubits and their multiple states.\u00a0\u00a0 These multiple states of multiple\u00a0\nqubits can be linked to each other,\u00a0\u00a0 or in the language of quantum mechanics,\u00a0\nthey are entangled with each other. Entangled\u00a0\u00a0 qubits work in a way that the operations\u00a0\nof one qubit can influence other qubits,\u00a0\u00a0 no matter how far apart they are, and can also\u00a0\ninfluence the entire system. This allows for\u00a0\u00a0 significantly higher computational power,\u00a0\nsomething that classical computers cannot\u00a0\u00a0 achieve. Entangled qubits function seamlessly due\u00a0\nto a phenomenon called quantum entanglement. We\u00a0\u00a0 have already made a dedicated video on quantum\u00a0\nentanglement; the link is in the description. Additionally, a quantum computer\u00a0\nlooks nothing like your regular\u00a0\u00a0 computer or laptop. When you walk into\u00a0\na room housing a quantum computer,\u00a0\u00a0 what you will most likely notice first\u00a0\nis large, complex-looking machinery,\u00a0\u00a0 much like a chandelier, with golden, silver,\u00a0\nand blue parts. Around it is a maze of wires,\u00a0\u00a0 tubes, and other intricate components. The\u00a0\nsetup looks straight out of a sci-fi movie. Quantum computers have been in existence in\u00a0\nvarious forms for several years. In fact,\u00a0\u00a0 some tech companies already possess\u00a0\noperational quantum computers that\u00a0\u00a0 serve as valuable resources for software\u00a0\ndevelopment and programming languages. The most significant advancement in quantum\u00a0\ncomputing in recent years occurred in October\u00a0\u00a0 2019, when Google asserted that it had achieved\u00a0\nquantum supremacy with its quantum computer. This\u00a0\u00a0 entailed using their specialized Sycamore\u00a0\nprocessor to perform a specific type of\u00a0\u00a0 computation much faster and more efficiently than\u00a0\nthe most powerful classical supercomputer. This\u00a0\u00a0 demonstration of quantum supremacy validated\u00a0\nthe concept that quantum computers can indeed\u00a0\u00a0 surpass classical computers in specific tasks by\u00a0\nleaps and bounds and can execute operations that\u00a0\u00a0 classical computers cannot. This progress also\u00a0\nprompted other companies, such as Microsoft, IBM,\u00a0\u00a0 and several startups, to intensify their quantum\u00a0\nresearch in pursuit of even greater results. Once the full potential of\u00a0\nquantum computers is realized,\u00a0\u00a0 it will herald a world of truly\u00a0\nunimaginable possibilities. Quantum computers have immense computational\u00a0\ncapabilities that will greatly enhance artificial\u00a0\u00a0 intelligence. Quantum cloud computing services\u00a0\nhave the potential to revolutionize machine\u00a0\u00a0 learning by processing extensive amounts of data\u00a0\nand complex calculations at unprecedented speeds.\u00a0\u00a0 In cybersecurity, quantum computers could\u00a0\nuphold data encryption during active use,\u00a0\u00a0 providing robust protection. They are\u00a0\nalso poised to revolutionize medical and\u00a0\u00a0 drug research, weather forecasting,\u00a0\nand automobile battery technology. While it will likely take many years before\u00a0\nquantum computers become mainstream and see\u00a0\u00a0 large-scale commercial use, it doesn't\u00a0\nseem like an exaggeration to say that\u00a0\u00a0 quantum computers will eventually be powerful\u00a0\nenough to not only solve complex problems,\u00a0\u00a0 but also help you find your missing socks, predict\u00a0\nthe outcome of your next dinner date, and maybe\u00a0\u00a0 even explain why you walked into the kitchen only\u00a0\nto forget why you were there in the first place."

However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.",

Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic \"Deterministic\") rules. (A [classical computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Modern_computers \"Computer\") can, in principle, be replicated by a [classical mechanical device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine \"Turing machine\"), with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require [exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth \"Exponential growth\") more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform _some_ calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could [break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography \"Post-quantum cryptography\") and aid physicists in performing [physical simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_simulator \"Quantum simulator\"). However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\n\nThe basic [unit of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_information \"Unit of information\") in quantum computing, the [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit \"Qubit\") (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit \"Bit\") in ordinary or \"classical\" computing.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMermin20071-1) However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number \"Binary number\")), a qubit can exist in a [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination \"Linear combination\") of two states known as a [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition \"Quantum superposition\"). The result of [measuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics \"Measurement in quantum mechanics\") a qubit is one of the two states given by a [probabilistic rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule \"Born rule\"). If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference \"Wave interference\") effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of [quantum algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithms \"Quantum algorithms\") involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\n\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system \"Isolated system\") from its environment, it suffers from [quantum decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence \"Quantum decoherence\"), introducing [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing) \"Noise (signal processing)\") into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include [superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing \"Superconducting quantum computing\") (which isolate an [electrical current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_current \"Electrical current\") by eliminating [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance \"Electrical resistance\")) and [ion traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer \"Trapped ion quantum computer\") (which confine a single [atomic particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom \"Atom\") using [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_fields \"Electromagnetic fields\")). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or [quantum supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy \"Quantum supremacy\"). These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see [Timeline of quantum computing and communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing_and_communication \"Timeline of quantum computing and communication\").\n\nFor many years, the fields of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics \"Quantum mechanics\") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\") formed distinct academic communities.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAaronson2013132-2)[Modern quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_quantum_theory \"Modern quantum theory\") was developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-Zwiebach2022-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-4) and [digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computers \"Digital computers\") emerged in the following decades to replace [human computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computers \"Human computers\") for tedious calculations.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-5) Both disciplines had practical applications during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"); computers played a major role in [wartime cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_cryptography \"World War II cryptography\"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-6) and quantum physics was essential for [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics \"Nuclear physics\") used in the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project \"Manhattan Project\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-7)\n\nAs [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicists \"Physicists\") applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit \"Bit\") for [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubits \"Qubits\"), the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, [Paul Benioff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Benioff \"Paul Benioff\") introduced the [quantum Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine \"Quantum Turing machine\"), which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-The_computer_as_a_physical_system-8) When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time \"Exponential time\") increase in overhead when [simulating quantum dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulating_quantum_dynamics \"Simulating quantum dynamics\"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-9) prompting [Yuri Manin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Manin \"Yuri Manin\") and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman \"Richard Feynman\") to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-manin1980vychislimoe-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang2010214-12) In a 1984 paper, [Charles Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Bennett_(physicist) \"Charles H. Bennett (physicist)\") and [Gilles Brassard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Brassard \"Gilles Brassard\") applied quantum theory to [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography \"Cryptography\") protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security \"Information security\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-bb84-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-personal-14)\n\n[Quantum algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm \"Quantum algorithm\") then emerged for solving [oracle problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine \"Oracle machine\"), such as [Deutsch's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%27s_algorithm \"Deutsch's algorithm\") in 1985,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-15) the [Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein%E2%80%93Vazirani_algorithm \"Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm\") in 1993,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-16) and [Simon's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_algorithm \"Simon's algorithm\") in 1994.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-17) These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could obtain more information by querying a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box \"Black box\") with a quantum state in [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition \"Quantum superposition\"), sometimes referred to as _quantum parallelism_.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang201030-32-18)\n\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Peter_Shor_2017_Dirac_Medal_Award_Ceremony.png/250px-Peter_Shor_2017_Dirac_Medal_Award_Ceremony.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peter_Shor_2017_Dirac_Medal_Award_Ceremony.png)\n\n[Peter Shor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor \"Peter Shor\") (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break [RSA encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_encryption \"RSA encryption\").\n\n[Peter Shor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor \"Peter Shor\") built on these results with [his 1994 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm \"Shor's algorithm\") for breaking the widely used [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) \"RSA (cryptosystem)\") and [Diffie\u2013Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman \"Diffie\u2013Hellman\") encryption protocols,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShor1994-19) which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm \"Grover's algorithm\") established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable [unstructured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data \"Unstructured data\") search problem.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang20107-21) The same year, [Seth Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Lloyd \"Seth Lloyd\") proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-273.5278.1073-22) validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-23)\n\nOver the years, [experimentalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics \"Experimental physics\") have constructed small-scale quantum computers using [trapped ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer \"Trapped ion quantum computer\") and superconductors.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrumblingHorowitz2019164%E2%80%93169-24) In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-26) and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrumblingHorowitz2019164%E2%80%93169-24)\n\nIn 2019, [Google AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI \"Google AI\") and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA \"NASA\") announced that they had achieved [quantum supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy \"Quantum supremacy\") with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that any classical computer would find impossible.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-1910.11333-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-30)\n\nThis announcement was met with a rebuttal from [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), which contended that the calculation Google claimed would take 10,000 years could be performed in just 2.5 days on its [Summit supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_supercomputer \"Summit supercomputer\") if its architecture were optimized, sparking a debate over the precise threshold for \"quantum supremacy\".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-31)\n\nQuantum information processing\n------------------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Quantum information processing\")]\n\n[Computer engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering \"Computer engineering\") typically describe a [modern computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_computer \"Modern computer\")'s operation in terms of [classical electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism \"Classical electromagnetism\"). In these \"classical\" computers, some components (such as [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor \"Semiconductor\") and [random number generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation \"Random number generation\")) may rely on quantum behavior; however, because they are not [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system \"Isolated system\") from their environment, any [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information \"Quantum information\") eventually quickly [decoheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence \"Quantum decoherence\"). While [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer \"Programmer\") may depend on [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory \"Probability theory\") when designing a [randomized algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm \"Randomized algorithm\"), quantum-mechanical notions such as [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination \"Linear combination\") and [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference \"Wave interference\") are largely irrelevant in [program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis \"Program analysis\").\n\n[Quantum programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming \"Quantum programming\"), in contrast, rely on precise control of [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_coherence \"Quantum coherence\") quantum systems. Physicists [describe these systems mathematically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics \"Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics\") using [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra \"Linear algebra\"). [Complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number \"Complex number\") model [probability amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude \"Probability amplitude\"), [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) \"Vector (mathematics and physics)\") model [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state \"Quantum state\"), and [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) \"Matrix (mathematics)\") model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of [composing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science) \"Function composition (computer science)\") operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.\n\nAs physicist [Charlie Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Bennett_(physicist) \"Charles H. Bennett (physicist)\") describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-32)\n\n> A classical computer is a quantum computer... so we shouldn't be asking about \"where do quantum speedups come from?\" We should say, \"Well, all computers are quantum.... Where do classical slowdowns come from?\"\n\n### Quantum information\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Quantum information\")]\n\nJust as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the _[qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit \"Qubit\")_ is the fundamental unit of [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information \"Quantum information\"). The same term _qubit_ is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states, often written |0\u27e9{\\displaystyle |0\\rangle }![Image 9: {\\displaystyle |0\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed066a3ad158da0ad6d6a421a606b1c8a35eb95b) and |1\u27e9{\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }![Image 10: {\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f53021ca18e77477ee5bd3c1523e5830189ec5c), serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states |0\u27e9{\\displaystyle |0\\rangle }![Image 11: {\\displaystyle |0\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed066a3ad158da0ad6d6a421a606b1c8a35eb95b) and |1\u27e9{\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }![Image 12: {\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f53021ca18e77477ee5bd3c1523e5830189ec5c) belong to a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space \"Vector space\"), meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state.

In general, the vector space for an _n_-qubit system is 2 _n_-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2 100 classical values.\n\n### Unitary operators\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Unitary operators\")]\n\nSee also: [Unitarity (physics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics) \"Unitarity (physics)\")\n\nThe state of this one-qubit [quantum memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_memory \"Quantum memory\") can be manipulated by applying [quantum logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate \"Quantum logic gate\"), analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [classical logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate \"Logic gate\"). One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) \"Matrix (mathematics)\")X:=(0 1 1 0).{\\displaystyle X:={\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}}.}![Image 35: {\\displaystyle X:={\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7d92d08efa8ccef15f7593ccfdb140edef506d9) Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modeled with [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication \"Matrix multiplication\").

One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are |00\u27e9:=(1 0 0 0);|01\u27e9:=(0 1 0 0);|10\u27e9:=(0 0 1 0);|11\u27e9:=(0 0 0 1).{\\displaystyle |00\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |01\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |10\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |11\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}}.}![Image 38: {\\displaystyle |00\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |01\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |10\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |11\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a55c7ee07f3a61799148cc67ebc11b82df3e3ca2) The [controlled NOT (CNOT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate \"Controlled NOT gate\") gate can then be represented using the following matrix: CNOT:=(1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0).{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {CNOT} :={\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&1\\\\0&0&1&0\\end{pmatrix}}.}![Image 39: {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {CNOT} :={\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&1\\\\0&0&1&0\\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d17fcf6a57b6d3b886d9d5073032b1e7695518aa) As a mathematical consequence of this definition, CNOT\u2061|00\u27e9=|00\u27e9{\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |00\\rangle =|00\\rangle }![Image 40: {\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |00\\rangle =|00\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed0a5336f1e26a22df63063316d4b0dbaf266328), CNOT\u2061|01\u27e9=|01\u27e9{\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |01\\rangle =|01\\rangle }![Image 41: {\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |01\\rangle =|01\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b89c86631eaaf54086afc0199de442765d8aa72), CNOT\u2061|10\u27e9=|11\u27e9{\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |10\\rangle =|11\\rangle }![Image 42: {\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |10\\rangle =|11\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41135fc98eb537e37245efa719378d9f726f5754), and CNOT\u2061|11\u27e9=|10\u27e9{\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |11\\rangle =|10\\rangle }![Image 43: {\\textstyle \\operatorname {CNOT} |11\\rangle =|10\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d5dd1790f487ed75a103c6d09e4aa61d6135bcb).

However, any [measurement can be deferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_measurement_principle \"Deferred measurement principle\") to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most [quantum circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit \"Quantum circuit\") depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\n\n### Quantum parallelism\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Quantum parallelism\")]\n\n_Quantum parallelism_ is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, enabling the simultaneous computation of multiple outputs. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, \"parallelism\" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang201030%E2%80%9332-38)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMermin200738%E2%80%9339-39)\n\n### Quantum programming\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Quantum programming\")]\n\nFurther information: [Quantum programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_programming \"Quantum programming\")\n\nThere are multiple [models of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation \"Model of computation\") for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.\n\n#### Gate array\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Gate array\")]\n\n[![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Quantum_Toffoli_Gate_Implementation.svg/290px-Quantum_Toffoli_Gate_Implementation.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quantum_Toffoli_Gate_Implementation.svg)\n\nA quantum circuit diagram implementing a [Toffoli gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate \"Toffoli gate\") from [more primitive gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate \"Quantum logic gate\")\n\nA [quantum gate array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit \"Quantum circuit\") decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit [quantum gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gate \"Quantum gate\").

A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [universal gate set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Universal_quantum_gates \"Quantum logic gate\"), since a computer that can run such circuits is a [universal quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantum_computer \"Universal quantum computer\"). One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates.

Conventional encryption, the obscuring of a message with a key through an algorithm, relies on the algorithm being difficult to reverse. Encryption is also the basis for digital signatures and authentication mechanisms. Quantum computing may be sufficiently more powerful that difficult reversals are feasible, allowing messages relying on conventional encryption to be read.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-Gisin-2002-52)\n\nQuantum cryptography replaces conventional algorithms with computations based on quantum computing.

Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-zoo-58)\n\nQuantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm \"Shor's algorithm\") for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing [discrete logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm \"Discrete logarithm\"), solving [Pell's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation \"Pell's equation\"), and, more generally, solving the [hidden subgroup problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem \"Hidden subgroup problem\") for [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group \"Abelian group\") finite groups.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-zoo-58) These algorithms depend on the primitive of the [quantum Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform \"Quantum Fourier transform\"). No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-59) Certain oracle problems like [Simon's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_problem \"Simon's problem\") and the [Bernstein\u2013Vazirani problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein%E2%80%93Vazirani_algorithm \"Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm\") do give provable speedups, though this is in the [quantum query model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory#Quantum_query_complexity \"Quantum complexity theory\"), which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and don't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.\n\nOther problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain [Jones polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial \"Jones polynomial\"), and the [quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_systems_of_equations \"Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations\"), have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are [BQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP \"BQP\")-complete.

[Integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization \"Integer factorization\"), which underpins the security of [public key cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography \"Public key cryptography\") systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible on a [classical computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer \"Computer\") for large integers if they are the product of a few [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number \"Prime number\") (e.g., the product of two 300-digit primes).[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-70) By contrast, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to factor the integer.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang2010216-71) This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography \"Cryptography\") systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_time \"Polynomial time\") (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [public key ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Algorithms \"Asymmetric Algorithms\") are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [discrete logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm \"Discrete logarithm\") problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm) \"RSA (algorithm)\"), [Diffie\u2013Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman \"Diffie\u2013Hellman\"), and [elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman \"Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman\") algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nIdentifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of _post-quantum cryptography_.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-pqcrypto_survey-72)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-73) Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, such as the [McEliece cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem \"McEliece cryptosystem\"), which relies on a hard problem in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory \"Coding theory\").[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-pqcrypto_survey-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-74)[Lattice-based cryptosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography \"Lattice-based cryptography\") are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the [dihedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group \"Dihedral group\")[hidden subgroup problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem \"Hidden subgroup problem\"), which would break many lattice-based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-75) It has been shown that applying Grover's algorithm to break a [symmetric (secret-key) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm \"Symmetric-key algorithm\") by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2 _n_/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2 _n_ in the classical case,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-bennett_1997-76) meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have comparable security against an attack using Grover's algorithm to that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see _[Key size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key\\_size#Effect\\_of\\_quantum\\_computing\\_attacks\\_on\\_key\\_strength \"Key size\")_).\n\n### Search problems\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Search problems\")]\n\nMain article: [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm \"Grover's algorithm\")\n\nThe most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is _unstructured search_, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of n{\\displaystyle n}![Image 50: {\\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) items in a database.

In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including [Brassard, H\u00f8yer, and Tapp's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHT_algorithm \"BHT algorithm\") for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-77) and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-78)\n\nProblems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-79)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-80)\n\n1.   There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n2.   The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n3.   There exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer.\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-81) is a [Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem \"Boolean satisfiability problem\"), where the _database_ through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers. An example and possible application of this is a [password cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking \"Password cracking\") that attempts to guess a password.

[Superconducting quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing \"Superconducting quantum computing\"), like those constructed by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\") and [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), need [helium-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3 \"Helium-3\"), a [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics \"Nuclear physics\") research byproduct, and special [superconducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting \"Superconducting\") cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-96)\n\nThe control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of [quantum controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_controllers&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Quantum controllers (page does not exist)\") that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-97)\n\n#### Decoherence\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: Decoherence\")]\n\nOne of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment, as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, the lattice vibrations, and the background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time _T_ 2 (for [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance \"Nuclear magnetic resonance\") and [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI \"MRI\") technology, also called the _dephasing time_), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-DiVincenzo_1995-98) Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a [dilution refrigerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator \"Dilution refrigerator\")[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-99)) in order to prevent significant decoherence.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-100) A 2020 study argues that [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation \"Ionizing radiation\") such as [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays \"Cosmic rays\") can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-101)\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-102)\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter, and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [pulse shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_shaping \"Pulse shaping\"). Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence, any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described by the [threshold theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_theorem \"Threshold theorem\"), if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use [quantum error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction \"Quantum error correction\") to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10\u22123, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between _L_ and _L_ 2, where _L_ is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of _L_. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10 4 bits without error correction.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-103) With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10 7 bits. Computation time is about _L_ 2 or about 10 7 steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-:1-104)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-:2-105) show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-106) for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger.\n\nOne approach to overcoming errors combines [low-density parity-check code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code \"Low-density parity-check code\") with [cat qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_qubit_quantum_computer \"Cat qubit quantum computer\") that have intrinsic bit-flip error suppression. Implementing 100 logical qubits with 768 cat qubits could reduce the error rate to one part in 10 8 per cycle per bit.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-107)\n\nAnother approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [topological quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer \"Topological quantum computer\") with [anyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon \"Anyon\"), [quasi-particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-particle \"Quasi-particle\") used as threads, and relying on [braid theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_theory \"Braid theory\") to form stable logic gates.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-108)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-109) Non-Abelian anyons can, in effect, remember how they have been manipulated, making them potentially useful in quantum computing.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-:0-110) As of 2025, Microsoft and other organizations are investing in quasi-particle research.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-:0-110)\n\n### Quantum supremacy\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Quantum supremacy\")]\n\nPhysicist [John Preskill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Preskill \"John Preskill\") coined the term _quantum supremacy_ to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-111)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-preskill2018-48)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-112) The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-113)\n\nIn October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the [Sycamore quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore_processor \"Sycamore processor\") more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on [Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer) \"Summit (supercomputer)\"), generally considered the world's fastest computer.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-1910.11333-28)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-114)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-115) This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed,[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-116)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-117) and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-118)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-119)[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-120) and even beating it.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-121)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-122)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-123)\n\nIn December 2020, a group at [USTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China \"University of Science and Technology of China\") implemented a type of [Boson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling \"Boson sampling\") on 76 photons with a [photonic quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_optical_quantum_computing \"Linear optical quantum computing\"), [Jiuzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuzhang_(quantum_computer) \"Jiuzhang (quantum computer)\"), to demonstrate quantum supremacy.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-124)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-125)[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-126) The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-:6-127)\n\nClaims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing,[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-128) but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-good-for-nothing-92)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-129)\n\nIn January 2024, a study published in _Physical Review Letters_ provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm. This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-130)\n\n### Skepticism\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Skepticism\")]\n\nDespite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 [Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal) \"Nature (journal)\") spotlight article summarized current quantum computers as being \"For now, [good for] absolutely nothing\".[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-good-for-nothing-92) The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that, in the long term, such computers are likely to be useful. A 2023 [Communications of the ACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM \"Communications of the ACM\") article[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-CACM-93) found that current quantum computing algorithms are \"insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack\". It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are \"small-data problems\", for example, in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, \"will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future\", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for \"big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm\".\n\nThis state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.\n\n*   Conventional computer hardware and algorithms are not only optimized for practical tasks, but are still improving rapidly, particularly [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU \"GPU\") accelerators.\n*   Current quantum computing hardware generates only a limited amount of [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement \"Quantum entanglement\") before getting overwhelmed by noise.\n*   Quantum algorithms provide speedup over conventional algorithms only for some tasks, and matching these tasks with practical applications proved challenging. Some promising tasks and applications require resources far beyond those available today.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-131)[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-132) In particular, processing large amounts of non-quantum data is a challenge for quantum computers.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-CACM-93)\n*   Some promising algorithms have been \"dequantized\", i.e., their non-quantum analogues with similar complexity have been found.\n*   If [quantum error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction \"Quantum error correction\") is used to scale quantum computers to practical applications, its overhead may undermine the speedup offered by many quantum algorithms.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-CACM-93)\n*   Complexity analysis of algorithms sometimes makes abstract assumptions that do not hold in applications. For example, input data may not already be available encoded in quantum states, and \"oracle functions\" used in Grover's algorithm often have internal structure that can be exploited for faster algorithms.\n\nIn particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain a sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptotically improve upon those bounds.\n\n[Bill Unruh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Unruh \"Bill Unruh\") doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-133)[Paul Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Davies \"Paul Davies\") argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the [holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle \"Holographic principle\").[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-134) Skeptics like [Gil Kalai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Kalai \"Gil Kalai\") doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-135)[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-136)[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-137) Physicist [Mikhail Dyakonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Dyakonov \"Mikhail Dyakonov\") has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:\n\n\"So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be... about 10 300...

However, the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, and microwave and radio frequency equipment, making full-scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment. Moreover, the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrumblingHorowitz2019119-144)\n\nThe largest commercial systems are based on [superconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductor \"Superconductor\") devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits.

It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine \"Turing machine\"). In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [computability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability \"Computability\"). This means that quantum computers cannot solve [undecidable problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem \"Undecidable problem\") like the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem \"Halting problem\"), and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the [Church\u2013Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis \"Church\u2013Turing thesis\").[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang2010126-149)\n\n### Complexity\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_computing&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Complexity\")]\n\nMain article: [Quantum complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory \"Quantum complexity theory\")\n\nWhile quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently [factor integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization \"Integer factorization\"), while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.\n\nThe class of [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem \"Computational problem\") that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called [BQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP \"BQP\"), for \"bounded error, quantum, polynomial time\". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [BPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded-error_probabilistic_polynomial \"Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial\") (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time [probabilistic Turing machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine \"Probabilistic Turing machine\") with bounded error.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang201041-150) It is known that B P P\u2286B Q P{\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {BPP\\subseteq BQP}}}![Image 55: {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {BPP\\subseteq BQP}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59af787cd2b2478c3c326d722fbffbc7839c1abe) and is widely suspected that B Q P\u228aB P P{\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {BQP\\subsetneq BPP}}}![Image 56: {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {BQP\\subsetneq BPP}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/106869205d6945f52c45f002a693dfb27d54574c), which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity \"Time complexity\").[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang2010201-151)\n\n[![Image 57](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/BQP_complexity_class_diagram.svg/250px-BQP_complexity_class_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BQP_complexity_class_diagram.svg)\n\nThe suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielsenChuang201042-60)\n\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity) \"P (complexity)\"), [NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity) \"NP (complexity)\"), and [PSPACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE_(complexity) \"PSPACE (complexity)\") is not known. However, it is known that P\u2286B Q P\u2286P S P A C E{\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {P\\subseteq BQP\\subseteq PSPACE}}}![Image 58: {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {P\\subseteq BQP\\subseteq PSPACE}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e30ec0b4e850418f5478e8a8e91fd2ccb20d0ebb); that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning that there exist problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm_problem \"Discrete logarithm problem\") are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that N P\u2288B Q P{\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {NP\\nsubseteq BQP}}}![Image 59: {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {NP\\nsubseteq BQP}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52b2cc3f547f6bad0a6b40df6a38349b52541c28); that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete \"NP-complete\") problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from [NP-hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard \"NP-hard\") that all problems in NP are in

Quantum physics has replaced classical physics as the correct fundamental description of our physical universe. It is used routinely to describe most phenomena that occur at short distances. [...] The era of quantum physics began in earnest in 1925 with the discoveries of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Werner Heisenberg. The seeds for these discoveries were planted by Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, and others.\n4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_ref-4)**[Weinberg, Steven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg \"Steven Weinberg\") (2015). \"Historical Introduction\". _Lectures on Quantum Mechanics_ (2nd ed.).

The laws of quantum mechanics allow qubits to encode exponentially more information than bits. By manipulating information stored in these qubits, scientists can quickly produce high-quality solutions to difficult problems.

The laws of [quantum mechanics](/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics \"DOE Explains...Quantum Mechanics\") allow qubits to encode exponentially more information than bits. By manipulating information stored in these qubits, scientists can quickly produce high-quality solutions to difficult problems. This means quantum computing may revolutionize our ability to solve problems that are hard to address with even the largest supercomputers. Scientists have demonstrated these quantum speedups in several applications, including database searches. The race is now on to find others.\n\nResearchers expect quantum computers to be particularly good at calculating properties of physical systems that are inherently quantum mechanical. These applications include molecules used as chemical catalysts, which despite their large size are subject to quantum mechanics. They also include the [quarks and gluons](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquarks-and-gluons) that clump together inside the [nuclei](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsnuclei) of atoms. Quantum computers may also be especially good at solving optimization problems, which involve choosing the best alternative from a huge range of options. The quantum computers available today are small, noisy prototypes, but the field is progressing rapidly. Quantum computers may soon become a critical part of the computing landscape as we move beyond cutting-edge Exascale computers.\n\n## DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Quantum Computing\n\nSupport for quantum computing research originated in the Advanced Scientific Computing Research program in 2017 and rapidly spread across the Office of Science.

Quantum computing is based on the rules of quantum mechanics, harnessing effects that exist at the level of atoms, electrons and photons. It involves encoding and processing information by controlling quantum states, relying on the uniquely quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement.\n\n## Qubits\n\nIn conventional computing, information is encoded as binary digits or \u2018bits\u2019 \u2013 a basic unit of information \u2013 that can be represented as either a \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019.

A register can be constructed from multiple qubits, which can then become correlated with each other in a subtle and powerful way that cannot exist in the ordinary, classical world \u2014 this is called quantum entanglement. The combination of superposition and entanglement means that a quantum register can encode information in a large number of states simultaneously. This feature is crucial in enabling a quantum computer\u2019s power, allowing it to perform computations for tasks that are intractable for even the largest current supercomputers.\n\n## Full stack & architecture\n\nQuantum computers can have different architectures, being based on alternative designs and constructed in different ways. As with conventional computers, there are several hardware and software layers involved in constructing a quantum computer, that go from the processor through to the user interface \u2013 this is referred to as the full stack.\n\n## Applications\n\nThe availability of quantum computing is expected to impact many sectors, enabling improvements in efficiency, productivity and competitiveness, as well as the creation of new products and services. Promising early applications include: the modelling and analysis of more complex molecules to accelerate the discovery of new materials and pharmaceuticals, the optimisation of complex planning and scheduling for logistics enhancing the design and manufacturing processes in sectors such as aerospace and automotive the optimisation of networks: the routing of traffic, telecommunications and energy distribution.\n\n## Technical challenges\n\nThere are several candidate hardware architectures on which to base quantum computers, each with their own merits and at various stages of technology maturity. The common feature is that physical qubits are inherently fragile, requiring precise control and protection from the external environment. The states need to be as long-lived as possible and the operations on them high-fidelity, otherwise errors accumulate, and more computational resource is required for error correction. Architectures that require limited or even no error correction are being investigated. Technical hurdles have continually been overcome as the field has advanced, but there are significant engineering challenges that lie ahead in scaling to ever greater numbers of qubits with low noise. We also need to learn more about the merits of the different hardware architectures as quantum computers are scaled. A real breakthrough would be to build and demonstrate quantum computers that provide enhanced performance for a range of different tasks. In the near term, we can explore how to tackle some of these challenges by developing NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) machines, which can provide a pathway to a general-purpose quantum computer in the future.\n\n "

A bit is a unit of information that can store either a zero or a one. By contrast, quantum computing is built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store both zeros _and_ ones. Qubits can represent any combination of both zero and one simultaneously; this is called superposition, and it is a basic feature of any quantum state. When a qubit\u2019s subatomic particles are in a superposition state, each subatomic particle can interact with and influence others, a phenomenon called quantum interference. Quantum chips make up the physical hardware that stores qubits, similar to microchips in classical computers.\n\nWhen a classical computer uses multiple variables to solve a problem, it must conduct a new calculation every time one of those variables changes. Each calculation is a single path to a single result. Quantum computers, on the other hand, can explore many paths in parallel through superposition.\n\nAdditionally, qubits can interact with one another through a phenomenon known as entanglement. Entanglement allows qubits to scale exponentially; two qubits, for example, can store and process four bits of information, three can process eight, and so on. This exponential scaling gives quantum computers much more power than classical computers.\n\nCurrently, organizations are mainly using [five qubit technologies](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/potential-and-challenges-of-quantum-computing-hardware-technologies)in their attempts to build a scalable, universal quantum computer. These technologies are photonic networks, superconducting circuits, spin qubits, neutral atoms, and trapped ions (exhibit).\n\nExhibit \n\n![Image 6: Five main qubit technologies are competing to build a scalable universal quantum computer.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/tech%20forward%20blog/potential%20and%20challenges%20of%20quantum%20computing%20hardware%20technologies/svgz-quantum-hardware-ex1-v3.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\n\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: [McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com](mailto:McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com)\n\nWhat are the most recent advancements in quantum computing?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome heavyweight tech organizations are already placing their bets on quantum technology. In 2024, Google unveiled an experimental quantum computer that, in five minutes\u2019 time, could perform a calculation that would take most supercomputers ten septillion years to finish\u2014longer than the age of the known universe. Google\u2019s quantum chip, called Willow, is primarily suited for research and specialized fields. Other organizations are also developing their own quantum computers, and as of 2022, the Chinese government had [pledged $15.3 billion in public funds](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/quantum-computing-funding-remains-strong-but-talent-gap-raises-concern)to quantum computing.\n\nIn February 2025, Microsoft [announced the discovery of a new state of matter](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-just-claimed-a-quantum-breakthrough-a-quantum-physicist-explains-what-it-means/) that it says will support a quantum computing breakthrough. After 17 years of physics research, the tech giant unveiled the Majorana 1 quantum chip. This microprocessor harnesses the properties of a material called a \u201ctopological qubit,\u201d which yields particles that are neither liquid, solid, nor gas\u2014though the reality of the new state of matter as well as the practical use of the new quantum machines has yet to be proven. Microsoft says the chip could be used to accelerate drug discovery, battery development, and the race toward AI dominance. Many scientists agree that Microsoft\u2019s topological qubits could lead to much more efficient and less complex error correction. They could also help avoid quantum decoherence, which happens when a quantum system loses its quantum properties and starts behaving more like a classical-computing system.\n\n![Image 7: Circular, white maze filled with white semicircles.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/mckinsey%20explainers/mckinseyexplainers-flat-thumb-1536x1536.jpg?cq=50&mh=145&car=16:9&cpy=Center)\n\n### Looking for direct answers to other complex questions?\n\n[Explore the full McKinsey Explainers series](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers)\n\nWhile the problems that quantum computers can solve are impressive compared with what current workaday computers can manage, they have limited real-world applications. But we are rapidly approaching a time when quantum computers _will_ have a real impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\nWhat are quantum computers used for?\n------------------------------------\n\nToday\u2019s classical computers are relatively straightforward. They work with a limited set of inputs and use an algorithm to spit out an answer\u2014and the bits that encode the inputs do not share information about one another. Quantum computers are different. For one, when data are input into the qubits, the qubits interact with other qubits, allowing for many different calculations to be run simultaneously; this is why quantum computers can work so much faster than classical computers. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Quantum computers don\u2019t deliver just one clear answer like classical computers do, but a range of possible answers.\n\nFor calculations that are limited in scope, classical computers are still the preferred tools. But for very complex problems, quantum computers can save time by narrowing down the range of possible answers.\n\nWhen will quantum computers be available?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOver the next few years, the major players in quantum computing\u2014as well as a small cohort of start-ups\u2014will work to steadily increase the number of qubits that their computers can handle and improve how the technology functions. Progress in quantum computing, however, is expected to remain a long-term race to achieve the quantum volume that\u2019s required to quickly solve real-world problems. According to McKinsey\u2019s conversations with tech executives, investors, and academics in quantum computing, 72 percent believe we\u2019ll see a [fully fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2035](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/is-winter-coming-quantum-computings-trajectory-in-the-years-ahead). The remaining 28 percent think this milestone won\u2019t be reached until 2040 or later.\n\nStill, some businesses will begin to derive value from quantum well before then. At first, businesses will receive quantum services via the cloud. As we\u2019ve seen, several major computing companies have already announced their quantum cloud offerings.\n\n_[Learn more about McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights)_.\n\nWhat\u2019s the relationship between quantum computing and AI?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuantum computing and [AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/whats-the-future-of-ai)have a [potentially symbiotic relationship](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/enabling-the-next-frontier-of-quantum-computing), and they stand to advance each other\u2019s capabilities and respective fields.

Quantum computing can enable AI applications to achieve the following milestones, which may eventually support AGI:\n\n    *   _enhanced computational power_, enabling the rapid data processing and computations needed for AGI\n    *   _more efficient problem-solving_, which boosts AI\u2019s advanced reasoning and decision-making\n    *   _improved learning capabilities_, which are critical for AGI\u2019s adaptability across diverse tasks and environments\n    *   _parallel processing_, which improves information analysis and synthesis \n    *   _easier handling of complex data structures_, which provides AI with tools to process and understand intricate information\n    *   _potential breakthroughs_ in AI research\n\n*   AI can enhance the development, optimization, and practical applications of quantum computing. Here are a few areas of quantum computing that could benefit from AI:\n\n    *   _Error correction._ Machine learning predicts and corrects quantum computation errors, improving quantum computers\u2019 reliability.\n    *   _Noise reduction._ AI can analyze noise patterns to develop reduction strategies.\n    *   _Quantum-algorithm design and optimization._ Both of these processes can happen via AI-like reinforcement learning.\n    *   _Quantum-hardware control._ AI can automate quantum-device calibration and dynamically adjust its control parameters.\n    *   _Resource management._ AI can help allocate qubits efficiently and optimize the scheduling of quantum tasks.\n    *   _Simulation and emulation._ AI can enhance quantum-system simulations for algorithm and hardware testing, as well as aid research by emulating quantum processes on classical hardware.\n    *   _Benchmarking and performance analysis._ AI can develop sophisticated benchmarking tools to evaluate and compare quantum devices and algorithms. \n    *   _Hybrid quantum\u2013classical systems._ AI can optimize the distribution of tasks between classical and quantum processors, maximizing overall efficiency. \n    *   _Quantum machine learning (QML)._ AI can improve the training of QML models by enhancing performance and applicability.\n\nWhat are some obstacles that may impede the development of quantum computing?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne major challenge in the advancement of quantum computing is the [volatility of qubits](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing). Whereas a bit in today\u2019s classical computers is in a state of either one or zero, a qubit can be any possible combination of the two. When a qubit changes its status, inputs can be lost or altered, which throws off the accuracy of the results. Another obstacle to development: For a quantum computer to operate at the scale that\u2019s needed to deliver significant breakthroughs, it will require potentially millions of qubits to be connected. The few quantum computers that exist today contain nowhere near that number of qubits.\n\nHere are some other challenges to [scaling quantum computing technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/is-winter-coming-quantum-computings-trajectory-in-the-years-ahead):\n\n*   _High-fidelity two-qubit gates at scale._ Maintaining \u201chigh fidelity\u201d (meaning a level of accuracy and reliability that\u2019s greater than 99.99 percent) is required for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Doing so at scale will be difficult. \n*   _Speed._ Qubits need to retain their quantum state to interact with one another. Even under specific environmental conditions, they will eventually degrade. \n*   _Multiqubit networking._ Connecting, or networking, qubits to one another could theoretically make quantum computers much more powerful. The key challenge here is connecting qubits across chips, or from one physical quantum computer to another.\n*   _Individual qubit control at scale._ The control of individual qubits becomes increasingly complex as the number of qubits in a given quantum computer increases. \n*   _Cooling power and environmental control._ As quantum computers become larger, the size and power requirements of the equipment to cool them become more and more costly, from both a financial and an environmental standpoint. Currently, powering a quantum computer large enough to connect millions of qubits is cost prohibitive for most companies. \n*   _Manufacturability._ Producing large numbers of quantum computers will require automation of both the manufacturing and testing processes. The production of certain quantum computers may require developing entirely new manufacturing techniques. \n\nHow can classical computers and quantum computers work together?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlowly, at first. Initially, [quantum computing will be used alongside classical computing](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing)to solve multivariable problems. One example? Quantum computers can narrow the range of possible solutions to a finance or logistics problem, helping a company reach the best solution faster. This kind of slower progress will be the norm until quantum computing advances enough to deliver more significant breakthroughs.\n\n_[Learn more about McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights)_.\n\nHow can organizations find the quantum computing talent they need?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere\u2019s a wide gap between the business need for quantum computing and the number of quantum professionals who are available to meet it. This [talent and skills gap](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/is-winter-coming-quantum-computings-trajectory-in-the-years-ahead)could jeopardize potential value creation, which McKinsey estimates to be as much as $1.3 trillion.\n\nThe talent challenge is felt differently by companies of different sizes. Small start-ups working in the quantum space typically grow out of university research labs and often have direct access to skilled candidates. Larger companies, though, might have less of a connection to these talent pools.\n\nMcKinsey research has found that there is only one qualified quantum candidate for every three quantum job openings. According to McKinsey research, less than 50 percent of quantum jobs in 2025 will be filled unless there are significant changes to either the talent pool or the predicted rate of quantum job creation.\n\nHere are [five lessons from the AI talent journey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/five-lessons-from-ai-on-closing-quantums-talent-gap-before-its-too-late)that can help organizations build the quantum talent they need:\n\n*   _Define your talent needs clearly._ In the early days of AI, some organizations hired data scientists without a clear understanding of what skills were needed. To avoid making the same mistake with quantum, organizations should first identify possible fields of applications that a quantum computing team would work on, then ensure that new hires come from diverse areas of expertise.\n*   _Invest early in translators._ As the early buzz built up around AI, the role of analytics translators became crucial to helping leaders identify and prioritize the business challenges that AI was best suited to help solve. With quantum, there\u2019s a similar need: for translators with engineering, application, and scientific backgrounds who can help organizations understand the opportunities and identify the right players in this rapidly expanding ecosystem. \n*   _Create pathways for a diverse talent pipeline._ Many of the first AI models reflected the same biases from the information that was used to train them. Also common was a lack of diverse perspectives and experiences among the people who built and tested the models, which contributed to the bias issue. While it\u2019s too early to know all the risks that could emerge from quantum, we can expect similar challenges if a diverse and empowered quantum workforce is not involved with this new technology. \n*   _Build technology literacy for all._ For employees at all levels to make the best use of a new technology, they need a basic understanding of how it works and what it can do. With quantum, business leaders as well as workers up and down the supply chain\u2014in marketing, IT infrastructure, finance, and more\u2014will require basic fluency in quantum topics. \n*   _Don\u2019t forget talent development strategies._ Companies tend to focus heavily on talent attraction during times of technological foment, but that\u2019s just one piece of the talent puzzle. To retain specialists, companies need to carve out clear paths for talent development. One pharmaceutical company leans into both the purpose of its work\u2014developing use cases that help save lives\u2014and the freedom it offers its team to choose which quantum-related questions they work on and to collaborate with external experts and practitioners.\n\nWhat are potential business use cases for quantum computers?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuantum computers have [four fundamental capabilities](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing)that differentiate them from today\u2019s classical computers, all of which can be applied to a business context:\n\n*   _Quantum simulation._ Quantum computers can model complex molecules, which may eventually help reduce development time for chemical and pharmaceutical companies. When scientists are developing new drugs, they need to examine the structure of a molecule to understand how it will interact with other molecules. It\u2019s almost impossible for today\u2019s computers to provide accurate simulations, because each atom interacts with other atoms in complex ways. But experts believe that quantum computers are powerful enough to eventually be able to model even the most complex molecules in the human body. This opens up the possibility for [faster development of new drugs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing)and new, transformative cures.\n*   _Optimization and search._ Every industry relies on optimization in one way or another. Where are robots best placed on a factory floor? What\u2019s the shortest route for a company\u2019s delivery trucks to travel? There are myriad questions that need to be answered to optimize a company\u2019s efficiency and value creation. With classical computing, companies must make one complicated calculation after another\u2014a potentially time-consuming and costly process, considering the many variables in a given situation. Since a quantum computer is able to work with multiple variables simultaneously, it can be used to [quickly narrow the range of possible answers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing). From there, classical computing can be used to zero in on one precise answer. \n*   _Quantum AI._ Quantum computers have the potential to work with more advanced algorithms that could transform [machine learning](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-machine-learning)across a diverse range of industries, from automotive to pharmaceuticals. In particular, quantum computers could accelerate the arrival of self-driving vehicles. Companies such as Ford, GM, Volkswagen, and other mobility start-ups are running video and image data through complex neural networks. Their goal? To use AI to teach cars to make crucial driving decisions. Quantum computers\u2019 ability to perform multiple complex calculations with many variables simultaneously allows for [faster training of such AI systems](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing). \n*   _Prime factorization._ Today\u2019s businesses use large, complex prime numbers\u2014numbers that are too big for classical computers to process\u2014as the basis for their encryption efforts. Using a process called prime factorization, quantum computers will be able to use algorithms to solve these complex prime numbers more easily than classical computers can. (In fact, a quantum algorithm known as Shor\u2019s algorithm can theoretically do this; there\u2019s just not a computer powerful enough to run it.) Once quantum computers have advanced enough, new quantum-encryption technologies will be needed to [protect online services](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-game-plan-for-quantum-computing)\u2014and scientists are already working on quantum cryptography to prepare for this eventuality. McKinsey estimates quantum computers will be powerful enough for prime factorization by the late 2020s at the very earliest. \n\nAs these capabilities develop at pace with quantum computing power, additional use cases will likely proliferate.\n\nWhat are other quantum technologies aside from computing?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to McKinsey\u2019s analysis, quantum computing is still years away from widespread commercial application. But [other quantum technologies](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/industrials-and-electronics/our-insights/shaping-the-long-race-in-quantum-communication-and-quantum-sensing)such as [quantum communication](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/quantum-communication-growth-drivers-cybersecurity-and-quantum-computing)(QComm) and quantum sensing (QS) could become available much earlier.\n\nQuantum communication will help enable strong encryption protocols, which could greatly improve the security of sensitive information and help in the following situations:\n\n*   _Full security._ QComm applications such as quantum-encryption protocols and [quantum teleportation](https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-computing-information-teleportation/) help ensure complete protection when information is transferred between locations. These protocols are more secure than classical protocols, most of which are likely to be broken once quantum computers attain more computing power or can work with more efficient algorithms.\n*   _Enhanced quantum computing power._ QComm enables two important types of quantum processing: parallel quantum processing (where multiple processors are connected and simultaneously execute different calculations from the same problem) and blind quantum computing (where quantum communications provide access to remote, large-scale quantum computers in the cloud). Both types of processing are made possible by the entanglement of quantum particles, when particles such as qubits have connected properties (that is, one particle\u2019s properties can be manipulated by the actions done to another).\n\nQuantum sensing allows for more accurate measurements than ever before, including measurements of physical properties such as temperature, magnetic fields, and rotation. Once quantum sensors are better optimized and have decreased in size, they will be able to measure data that current sensors are unable to capture.\n\nThe markets for QComm and QS are currently smaller than the market for quantum computing, which has so far attracted most of the headlines and funding. But McKinsey expects both QComm and QS to attract serious interest and funding in the future. Although investing in these quantum technologies is not without risk, the potential payoff is high: By 2030, QComm and QS could generate $13 billion in revenues.\n\n_[Learn more about McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights)and check out[quantum computing job opportunities](https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs?query=quantum%20technologies)if you\u2019re interested in working at McKinsey_.\n\n_Articles referenced:_\n\n*   \u201c[Quantum communication growth drivers: Cybersecurity and quantum computing](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/quantum-communication-growth-drivers-cybersecurity-and-quantum-computing),\u201d February 21, 2025, [Henning Soller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/henning-soller), [Lareina Yee](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/lareina-yee), Michael Bogobowicz, and Rodney Zemmel, with Martina Gschwendtner \n*   \u201c[Enabling the next frontier of quantum computing](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/enabling-the-next-frontier-of-quantum-computing),\u201d September 19, 2024, [Henning Soller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/henning-soller), with Hussein Hijazi, Martina Gschwendtner, and Reem Taibah \n*   \u201c[Steady progress in approaching the quantum advantage](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage),\u201d April 24, 2024, Michael Bogobowicz, Kamalika Dutta, Martina Gschwendtner, Anna Heid, Mena Issler, [Niko Mohr](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/niko-mohr), [Henning Soller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/henning-soller), Rodney Zemmel, and Alex Zhang \n*   \u201c[Quantum computing: The time to act is now](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/quantum-computing-the-time-to-act-is-now),\u201d February 16, 2024, Martina Gschwendtner, Hussein Hijazi, Nicole Morgan, and [Henning Soller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/henning-soller)\n*   \u201c[Potential and challenges of quantum computing hardware technologies](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/tech-forward/potential-and-challenges-of-quantum-computing-hardware-technologies),\u201d December 1, 2023, Martina Gschwendtner, [Niko Mohr](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/niko-mohr), Nicole Morgan, and [Henning Soller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/henning-soller)\n*   \u201c[Gearing up for mobility\u2019s future with quantum computing](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/gearing-up-for-mobilitys-future-with-quantum-computing),\u201d September 13, 2023, Scarlett Gao,[Timo M\u00f6ller](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/timo-moller),[Niko Mohr](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/niko-mohr), Alexia Pastr\u00e9, and Felix Ziegler \n*   \u201c[Is winter coming?

To this end, Microsoft uses topological qubits, which are stabilized by manipulating their structure and surrounding them with chemical compounds that protect them from outside interference.\n\nHow does quantum computing work?",

first.\n\n### What is quantum?\n\nThe quantum in \"quantum computing\" refers to the quantum mechanics that the system uses to calculate outputs. In physics, a quantum is the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property. It usually refers to properties of atomic or subatomic particles, such as electrons, neutrinos, and photons.\n\n### What is a qubit?\n\nA qubit is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Qubits play a similar role in quantum computing as bits play in classical computing, but they behave very differently. Classical bits are binary and can hold only a position of 0 or 1, but qubits can hold a superposition of all possible states.\n\n### What is quantum computing?\n\nQuantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics\u2014such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference\u2014and apply it to computing. This introduces new concepts to traditional programming methods.\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/what-is-quantum-computing_supersition?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1454&hei=862&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)\n\nSuperposition\n-------------\n\nIn superposition, quantum particles are a combination of all possible states. They fluctuate until they're observed and measured. One way to picture the difference between binary position and superposition is to imagine a coin. Classical bits are measured by \"flipping the coin\" and getting heads or tails. However, if you were able to look at a coin and see both heads and tails at the same time, as well as every state in between, the coin would be in superposition.\n\nEntanglement\n------------\n\nEntanglement is the ability of quantum particles to correlate their measurement results with each other. When qubits are entangled, they form a single system and influence each other. We can use the measurements from one qubit to draw conclusions about the others. By adding and entangling more qubits in a system, quantum computers can calculate exponentially more information and solve more complicated problems.\n\n![Image 4](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/what-is-quantum-computing_entang-lement?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1454&qlt=100&fit=constrain)\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/what-is-quantum-computing_quantum-interference?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1454&hei=862&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)\n\nQuantum interference\n--------------------\n\nQuantum interference is the intrinsic behavior of a qubit, due to superposition, to influence the probability of it collapsing one way or another. Quantum computers are designed and built to reduce interference as much as possible and ensure the most accurate results. To this end, Microsoft uses topological qubits, which are stabilized by manipulating their structure and surrounding them with chemical compounds that protect them from outside interference.\n\nHow does quantum computing work?\n--------------------------------\n\nA quantum computer has three primary parts:\n\n*   An area that houses the qubits\n*   A method for transferring signals to the qubits\n*   A classical computer to run a program and send instructions\n\nFor some methods of qubit storage, the unit that houses the qubits is kept at a temperature just above absolute zero to maximize their coherence and reduce interference. Other types of qubit housing use a vacuum chamber to help minimize vibrations and stabilize the qubits.\n\nSignals can be sent to the qubits using a variety of methods, including microwaves, laser, and voltage.\n\n![Image 6: Data monitoring app performance and usage such as active users, daily sessions per user, session duration and top devices. ](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/how-quantum?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1454&hei=862&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)\n\n![Image 7](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/what-is-quantum-computing_full-image?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1280&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)\n\nQuantum computer uses and application areas\n-------------------------------------------\n\nA quantum computer can't do everything faster than a classical computer, but there are a few areas where quantum computers have the potential to make a big impact.\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/what-is-quantum-computing_quantum-use-cases?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=407&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)\n\n### Quantum simulation\n\nQuantum computers work exceptionally well for modeling other quantum systems because they use quantum phenomena in their computation. This means that they can handle the complexity and ambiguity of systems that would overload classical computers. Examples of quantum systems that we can model include photosynthesis, superconductivity, and complex molecular formations.\n\n### Cryptography\n\nClassical cryptography\u2014such as the Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) algorithm that\u2019s widely used to secure data transmission\u2014relies on the intractability of problems such as integer factorization or discrete logarithms. Many of these problems can be solved more efficiently using quantum computers.\n\n### Optimization\n\nOptimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem given its desired outcome and constraints. In science and industry, critical decisions are made based on factors such as cost, quality, and production time\u2014all of which can be optimized. By running quantum-inspired optimization algorithms on classical computers, we can find solutions that were previously impossible. This helps us find better ways to manage complex systems such as traffic flows, airplane gate assignments, package deliveries, and energy storage.\n\n### Quantum machine learning\n\nMachine learning on classical computers is revolutionizing the world of science and business. However, training machine learning models comes with a high computational cost, and that has hindered the scope and development of the field. To speed up progress in this area, we're exploring ways to devise and implement quantum software that enables faster machine learning.\n\n### Search\n\nA quantum algorithm developed in 1996 dramatically sped up the solution to unstructured data searches, running the search in fewer steps than any classical algorithm could.\n\nAzure Quantum resources\n-----------------------\n\nBuild quantum solutions today as an early adopter of Azure Quantum Preview, a full-stack open cloud ecosystem.

While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that classical [supercomputers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supercomputing) can\u2019t solve (or can\u2019t solve fast enough).\n\nBy taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours.\n\nQuantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone.\n\nThink Newsletter\n\n### Join over 100,000 subscribers who read the latest news in tech\n\nStay up to date on the most important\u2014and intriguing\u2014industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter.See the[IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy).\n\n### Thank you!

A computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to process information has certain advantages in modeling physical systems. Therefore, quantum computing is of particular interest for chemistry and material science applications. For example, quantum computers might help researchers seeking useful molecules for pharmaceutical or engineering applications identify candidates more quickly and efficiently.\n\nQuantum computers can also process data by using mathematical techniques not accessible to classical computers. That means they can give structure to data and help discover patterns that classical algorithms alone might miss. In practice, this might be useful for applications ranging from biology (for example, protein folding) to finance.\n\nToday, much of the work of quantum computing research involves searching for algorithms and applications within these broad categories of expected use. That is in addition to building the new technology itself.\n\nAs leading institutions like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well as startups like Rigetti and Ionq continue investing heavily in this exciting technology, [quantum computing is estimated to become a USD 1.3 trillion industry by 2035](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/quantum-technology-sees-record-investments-progress-on-talent-gap).\n\n IBM Quantum Computing \n\n### What is quantum computing?\n\nUse IBM Quantum Platform suite of applications to support your quantum research and development needs.

Compared to what we learned in grade-school physics, the behaviors of quantum objects are often bizarre and counterintuitive.\n\nDescribing the behaviors of quantum particles presents a unique challenge. Most common-sense paradigms for the natural world lack the vocabulary to communicate the surprising behaviors of quantum particles. But quantum mechanics reveals how the universe really works. Quantum computers take advantage of quantum mechanics by replacing traditional binary bit circuits with quantum particles called quantum bits, or qubits. These particles behave differently from bits, exhibiting unique properties that can be described only with quantum mechanics.\n\nTo understand quantum computing, it is important to understand four key quantum mechanics principles:\n\n*   Superposition\n*   Entanglement\n*   Decoherence\n*   Interference\n\n### Superposition\n\nA qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can place the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces.\n\nWhen a quantum system is measured, its state collapses from a superposition of possibilities into a binary state, which can be registered like binary code as either a zero or a one.\n\n### Entanglement\n\nEntanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits. Entangled systems are so intrinsically linked that when quantum processors measure a single entangled qubit, they can immediately determine information about other qubits in the entangled system.\n\n### Interference\n\nInterference is the engine of quantum computing. An environment of qubits placed into a state of collective superposition structures information in a way that looks like waves, with amplitudes associated with each outcome.\n\nThese amplitudes become the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement of the system. These waves can build on each other when many of them peak at a particular outcome or cancel each other out when peaks and troughs interact. Amplifying a probability or canceling out others are both forms of interference.\n\n### Decoherence\n\nDecoherence is the process in which a system in a quantum state collapses into a nonquantum state. It can be intentionally triggered by measuring a quantum system or by other environmental factors (sometimes these factors trigger it unintentionally). Generally speaking, quantum computing requires avoiding and minimizing decoherence.\n\n### How the principles work together\n\nTo better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states\u2014qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes\u2014behave randomly. The second is that distant objects\u2014in this case, entangled qubits\u2014can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated.\n\nA computation on a quantum computer works by preparing a superposition of computational states. A quantum circuit, prepared by the user, uses operations to entangle qubits and generate interference patterns, as governed by a quantum algorithm. Many possible outcomes are canceled out through interference, while others are amplified. The amplified outcomes are the solutions to the computation.\n\nHow do quantum computers work?\n------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nThe primary difference between classical and quantum computers is that quantum computers use qubits instead of bits. While quantum computing does use binary code, qubits process information differently from classical computers. But what are qubits and where do they come from?\n\n### What are qubits?\n\nWhile classical computers rely on bits (zeros and ones) to store and process data, quantum computers process data differently by using [quantum bits (qubits)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/qubit?) in superposition.\n\nA qubit can behave like a bit and store either a zero or a one, but it can also be a weighted combination of zero and one at the same time. When qubits are combined, their superpositions can grow exponentially in complexity: two qubits can be in a superposition of the four possible 2-bit strings, three qubits can be in a superposition of the eight possible 3-bit strings, and so on. With 100 qubits, the range of possibilities is astronomical.\n\nQuantum algorithms work by manipulating information in a way inaccessible to classical computers, which can provide dramatic speed-ups for certain problems\u2014especially when quantum computers and high-performance classical supercomputers work together.\n\n### Types of qubits\n\nGenerally, qubits are created by manipulating and measuring systems that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, such as superconducting circuits, photons, electrons, trapped ions and atoms.\n\nThere are many different ways of making the qubits used in quantum computing today, with some better suited for different types of tasks.\n\n A few of the more common types of qubits in use are as follows:\n\n*   **Superconducting qubits:**Made from superconducting materials operating at extremely low temperatures, these qubits are favored for their speed in performing computations and fine-tuned control.\n*   **Trapped ion qubits:**Trapped ion particles can also be used as qubits and are noted for long coherence times and high-fidelity measurements, but they are much slower than superconducting qubits.\n*   **Quantum dots:**Quantum dots are small semiconductors that capture a single electron and use it as a qubit, offering promising potential for scalability and compatibility with existing semiconductor technology.\n*   **Photons:**Photons are individual light particles. They can be used to make qubits and send quantum information across long distances through optical fiber cables. They are being used in quantum communication and [quantum cryptography](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-cryptography).\n\n### Why are qubits useful?\n\nComputers that use quantum bits have certain advantages over computers that use classical bits. Because qubits can hold a superposition and exhibit interference, a quantum computer that uses qubits approaches problems in ways different from classical computers.\n\nAs a helpful analogy for understanding how quantum computers use qubits to solve complicated problems, imagine you are standing in the center of a complicated maze. To escape the maze, a traditional classical computing approach would be to \u201cbrute force\u201d the problem, trying every possible combination of paths to find the exit. This kind of computer would use bits to explore new paths and remember which ones are dead ends.\n\nA quantum computer might derive the correct path without needing to test all the bad paths, as if it has a bird's-eye view of the maze. However, qubits don't test multiple paths at once. Instead, quantum computers measure the probability amplitudes of qubits to determine an outcome.\n\nThese amplitudes function like waves, overlapping and interfering with each other. When asynchronous waves overlap, it effectively eliminates possible solutions to complex problems, and the realized coherent wave or waves present a correct solution.\n\n Mixture of Experts | Quantum \n\n### Decoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\n\nAn exciting new announcement on fault-tolerant quantum computing: **IBM Quantum Starling** will arrive by 2029.\n\n Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\n\n[Watch the latest podcast episodes](https://www.ibm.com/think/podcasts/mixture-of-experts?XFPOD)\n\nQuantum computing components\n----------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nAn IBM quantum processor is a wafer not much bigger than the silicon chips found in a laptop. However, modern quantum hardware systems (used to keep the instruments at an ultracold temperature) and the extra room-temperature electronic components to control the system and process quantum data are about the size of an average car.\n\nWhile the large footprint of a complete quantum hardware system makes most quantum computers anything but portable, researchers and computer scientists are still able to access off-site quantum computing capabilities through [cloud computing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cloud-computing). The main hardware components of a quantum computer are as follows.\n\n### Quantum processors\n\nComposed of qubits laid out in various configurations to allow for communication, quantum chips\u2014also known as the quantum data plane\u2014act as the brain of the quantum computer.\n\nAs the core component in a quantum computer, a quantum processor contains the system\u2019s physical qubits and the structures required to hold them in place. [Quantum processing units (QPUs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/qpu) include the quantum chip, control electronics and classical compute hardware required for input and output.\n\n### Superconductors\n\nYour desktop computer likely uses a fan to get cold enough to work. Quantum processors need to be very cold\u2014about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero\u2014to minimize noise and avoid decoherence in order to retain their quantum states. This ultralow temperature is achieved with supercooled superfluids. At these temperatures, certain materials exhibit an important quantum mechanical effect: electrons move through them without resistance. This effect makes them superconductors.\n\nWhen materials become superconductors, their electrons match up, forming Cooper pairs. These pairs can carry a charge across barriers, or insulators, through a process known as quantum tunneling. Two superconductors placed on either side of an insulator form a Josephson junction, a crucial piece of quantum computing hardware.\n\n### Control\n\nQuantum computers use circuits with capacitors and Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits. By firing microwave photons at these qubits, we can control their behavior and get them to hold, change and read out individual units of quantum information.\n\n### Quantum software\n\nResearch continues improving quantum hardware components, but that\u2019s only one half of the equation. The crux of users\u2019 discovery of quantum advantage will be a highly performant and stable quantum software stack to enable the next generation of quantum algorithms.\n\nIn 2024, IBM introduced the[first stable version of the Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-software-vision#mark-first-stable-version-of-the-qiskit) open source software development kit (SDK), Qiskit SDK 1.x. With over 600,000 registered users and 700 global universities that use it to develop quantum computing classes, Qiskit has become the preferred software stack for quantum computing.\n\nBut Qiskit is more than just the world\u2019s most popular quantum development software to build and construct quantum circuits. We are redefining Qiskit to represent the full-stack software for quantum at IBM, extending the Qiskit SDK with middleware software and services to write, optimize and run programs on IBM Quantum systems\u2014including new [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai) code-assistance tools.\n\n The Coherence TImes - a quantum podcast | 25 November, episode 4 \n\n### Quantum explained: The Coherence Times\n\nWhether you\u2019re a scientist, tech enthusiast, innovator, or simply curious about quantum computing,_The Coherence Times_ offers in\u2011depth discussions on quantum mechanics, computing challenges, and industry\u2011changing breakthroughs. New episodes every other Tuesday at 7 AM ET.\n\n[Watch the first podcast episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/podcasts/the-coherence-times)\n\nClassical computing versus quantum computing\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nQuantum computing is built on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe how very small objects behave differently from large objects. But because quantum mechanics provides the foundational laws for our entire universe, on a very small level, every system is a quantum system.\n\nFor this reason, we can say that while conventional computers are also built on top of quantum systems, they fail to take full advantage of the quantum-mechanical properties during their calculations. Quantum computers are expected to take better advantage of quantum mechanics to conduct calculations that even high-performance computers cannot.\n\n### What is a classical computer?\n\nFrom antiquated punch-card adders to modern supercomputers, traditional (or classical) computers essentially function in the same way. These machines generally perform calculations sequentially, storing data by using binary bits of information. Each bit represents either a 0 or 1.\n\nWhen combined into binary code and manipulated by using logic operations, we can use computers to create everything from simple operating systems to the most advanced supercomputing calculations.\n\n### What is a quantum computer?\n\nQuantum computers, like classical computers, are problem-solving machines. But instead of bits, quantum computing uses qubits.Qubits are used to process data like traditional bits; however, by harnessing quantum phenomena, qubits have access to more complex mathematics for a different type of computation. This is due to quantum mechanical concepts known as superposition and interference, which were discussed earlier.\n\n### The difference between quantum and classical computing\n\n#### Classical computing\n\n*   Used by common, multipurpose computers and devices.\n*   Processes information in bits with a discrete number of possible states, 0 or 1.\n\n#### Quantum computing\n\n*   Used by specialized quantum mechanics-based quantum computing hardware.\n*   Processes information in qubits as 0, 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1.\n*   Processes data with quantum logic by using interference to solve problems.\n\nQuantum processors do not perform mathematical equations the same way classical computers do. Unlike classical computers that must compute every step of a complicated calculation, quantum circuits made from logical qubits can process complex problems more efficiently.\n\nWhile traditional computers commonly provide singular answers, probabilistic quantum machines often provide ranges of possible answers. This range might make quantum computing seem less precise than traditional computation. However, for the kinds of incredibly complex problems quantum computers might soon solve, this way of computing might potentially save hundreds of thousands of years of traditional computation.\n\nIn practice, quantum computers and classical computers work together in combined workflows to solve problems. The most efficient methods distribute the parts of a computation that quantum computers are best at to quantum computing resources and the parts that classical computers are best at to classical computing resources.\n\nFully realized quantum computers working in concert with [high-performance classical computers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hpc) would be far superior to classical computers alone for certain kinds of problems like integer factorization. But quantum computing is not ideal for every (or even most) problems.\n\nWhen is quantum computing superior?\n-----------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nFor most kinds of tasks and problems, classical computers are expected to remain the best solution. But when scientists and engineers encounter certain highly complex problems, quantum computing comes into play. For these types of difficult calculations, even the most powerful classical supercomputers pale in comparison to quantum computing. That\u2019s because even the most powerful classical supercomputers are binary code-based machines reliant on 20th-century technology.\n\nComplex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways. For example, modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem because of all the different interactions between electrons. Identifying new physics in a supercollider is also a complex problem. There are some complex problems that we do not know how to solve with classical computers at any practical scale.\n\nA classical computer might be great at difficult tasks like sorting through a large database of molecules. But it struggles to solve more complex problems, like simulating how those molecules behave.\n\nToday, if scientists want to know how a molecule behaves, they must synthesize it and experiment with it in the real world. If they want to know how a slight tweak would impact its behavior, they usually need to synthesize the new version and run their experiment all over again. This is an expensive, time-consuming process that impedes progress in fields as diverse as medicine and [semiconductor](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semiconductors) design.\n\nA classical supercomputer might try to simulate molecular behavior with brute force by using its many processors to explore every possible way every part of the molecule might behave. But as it moves past the simplest, most straightforward molecules available, the supercomputer stalls. No classical computer is able to handle all the possible permutations of molecular behavior by using any known methods.\n\nQuantum algorithms take a new approach to these sorts of complex problems by creating multidimensional computational spaces in which to run algorithms that behave much like these molecules themselves. This turns out to be a much more efficient way of solving complex problems like chemical simulations.\n\nOne way to think about this: Classical computers need to crunch the numbers to figure out how a molecule will behave. A quantum computer doesn\u2019t need to crunch the numbers. It can mimic the molecular system directly.\n\nQuantum algorithms can also process data in ways classical computers can\u2019t, offering new structure and insights.\n\nQuantum computing use cases\n---------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nFirst theorized in the early 1980s, it wasn\u2019t until 1994 that mathematician Peter Shor published one of the first practical real-world applications for a hypothetical quantum machine. Shor\u2019s algorithm for integer factorization demonstrated how a quantum mechanical computer could potentially break the most advanced cryptography systems of the time\u2014some of which are still used today. Shor\u2019s findings demonstrated a viable application for quantum systems, with dramatic implications for not just [cybersecurity](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cybersecurity), but many other fields.\n\nEngineering firms, financial institutions and global shipping companies, among others, are exploring use cases where quantum computers might solve important problems in their fields. An explosion of benefits from quantum research and development is taking shape on the horizon. As quantum hardware scales and quantum algorithms advance, we can soon find new solutions to big, important problems like molecular simulation, energy infrastructure management and financial market modeling.\n\nQuantum computers excel at solving certain complex problems with many variables. From the [development of new drugs](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/case-studies/modeling-realistic-chemistry)to advancements in[semiconductor development](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/jsr)and tackling complex energy challenges, quantum computing might hold the key to breakthroughs in several critical industries.\n\n Pharmaceuticals \n\nQuantum computers capable of simulating molecular behavior and biochemical reactions could speed up the research and development of life-saving new drugs and medical treatments.\n\n Chemistry \n\nFor the same reasons quantum computers could impact medical research, they might also provide undiscovered solutions for mitigating dangerous or destructive chemical byproducts. Quantum computing could lead to improved catalysts that enable petrochemical alternatives or better processes for the carbon breakdown necessary for combating climate-threatening emissions.\n\n Machine learning \n\nAs interest and investment in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) and related fields like [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) ramps up, researchers are pushing [AI models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model) to new extremes, testing the limits of our existing hardware and demanding tremendous energy consumption. There is some reason to think that quantum algorithms might be able to look at datasets in a new way, providing a speed-up for some machine learning problems.\n\nQuantum utility versus quantum advantage\n----------------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nWhile no longer simply theoretical, quantum computing is still under development. As scientists around the world strive to discover new techniques to improve the speed, power and efficiency of quantum machines, technology is approaching a turning point. We understand the evolution of useful quantum computing using the concepts of quantum advantage and quantum utility.\n\n### Quantum utility\n\n[Quantum utility](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/what-is-quantum-utlity) refers to any quantum computation that provides reliable, accurate solutions to problems that are beyond the reach of brute-force classical computing quantum-machine simulators. Previously, these problems were accessible only to classical approximation methods\u2014usually problem-specific approximation methods carefully crafted to exploit the unique structures of a specific problem. IBM first demonstrated quantum utility in 2023.\n\n### Quantum advantage\n\nBroadly defined, the term quantum advantage describes a situation where quantum can provide a better, faster, or cheaper solution than all known classical methods. An algorithm that exhibits quantum advantage on a quantum computer should be able to deliver a significant, practical benefit beyond all known classical computing methods. IBM expects that the first quantum advantages should be realized by late 2026, if the quantum and high-performance computing communities work together.\n\nQuantum benchmarks\n------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nBecause quantum computing now offers a viable alternative to classical approximation for certain problems, researchers say it is a useful tool for scientific exploration, or that it has utility. Quantum utility does not constitute a claim that quantum methods have achieved a proven speed-up over all known classical methods. This is a key difference from the concept of quantum advantage.\n\nIBM has introduced two metrics to benchmark quantum computers: [layer fidelity and circuit layer operations per second (CLOPS)](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-metric-layer-fidelity).\n\n### Layer fidelity\n\nAn extremely valuable benchmark, layer fidelity provides a way to encapsulate the entire quantum processor\u2019s ability to run circuits while revealing information about individual qubits, gates and crosstalk. By running the layer fidelity protocol, researchers can qualify the overall quantum device while also gaining access to granular performance and error information about individual components.\n\n### Quantum processing speed\n\nIn addition to layer fidelity, IBM also defined a speed metric: [circuit layer operations per second (CLOPS)](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/circuit-layer-operations-per-second). Currently, CLOPS is a measure of how quickly processors can run quantum volume circuits in series, acting as a measure of holistic system speed, incorporating quantum and classical computing.\n\nTogether, layer fidelity and CLOPS provide a new way to benchmark systems that\u2019s more meaningful to the people trying to improve and use quantum hardware. These metrics make it easier to compare systems to one another, to compare our systems to other architectures and to reflect performance gains across scales.\n\n### Circuit depth\n\nCircuit depth is also an essential capability of a quantum processing unit. It is a measure of the number of parallel gate executions\u2014the number of steps in a quantum circuit\u2014that the processing unit can run before the qubits decohere. The greater the circuit depth, the more complex circuits the computer can run.\n\nQuantum challenges and how to make quantum computers more useful\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\nToday, companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, D-Wave, Rigetti Computing and more make real quantum hardware. Cutting-edge tools that were merely theoretical four decades ago are now available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Engineers are delivering ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.\n\nNow that the field has achieved quantum utility, researchers are hard at work to make state-of-the-art quantum computers even more useful. Researchers at IBM Quantum and elsewhere have identified some key challenges to improve upon quantum utility and potentially achieve quantum advantage:\n\n1.   **Scaling quantum processors:**While qubit processors used in quantum computing have the potential to massively outperform bit-based processors, current quantum processors can support only a small number of potential qubits. As research progresses, IBM plans to introduce a quantum system with 200 logical qubits capable of running 100 million quantum gates by 2029, with a goal of 2,000 logical qubits capable of running 1 billion gates by 2033.\n2.   **Scaling quantum hardware:**Although powerful, qubits are also quite error-prone, requiring large cooling systems capable of creating temperatures lower than outer space. Researchers are currently developing ways to scale qubits, electronics, infrastructure and software to reduce footprint, cost and energy usage.\n3.   **Quantum error correction:**Decoherence, the process in which qubits fail to function properly and produce inaccurate results, is a major hurdle for any quantum system. Quantum error correction requires that we encode quantum information into more qubits than we would otherwise need. In 2024, IBM announced [a landmark new error-correcting code](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/nature-qldpc-error-correction) about 10 times more efficient than prior methods. While there are challenges remaining to implementing quantum error correcting codes and performing computations on encoded quantum information, this new code marks a clear path toward running quantum circuits with a billion logic gates or more.\n4.   **Quantum algorithm discovery:**Quantum advantage requires two components. The first is viable quantum circuits, and the second is a means to demonstrate that those quantum circuits are better than known classical methods at solving a quantum problem. [Quantum algorithm discovery](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-working-groups) is what will take current quantum technologies from quantum utility to quantum advantage.\n5.   **Quantum software and middleware:**Quantum computing for advantage requires a highly performant and stable software stack to write, optimize and execute quantum programs.[Open-source](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/open-source) and Python-based, IBM\u2019s [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-software-vision) is by far the most widely-used [quantum SDK](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) in the world. It is useful for executions both on IBM\u2019s fleet of superconducting quantum computers and on systems that use alternative technologies, such as ions trapped in magnetic fields or quantum annealing.\n6.   **Quantum-centric supercomputing:**For the foreseeable future, quantum computing will work in tandem with modern and future classical supercomputing to be useful. In response, quantum researchers are preparing for a world where classical supercomputers can use quantum circuits to help solve problems.\n\n Link copied \n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing&title=Quantum%20Computing)[](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)[](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Quantum%20Computing&url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing)\n\n[eBook The Quantum Decade Prepare for the most significant computing revolution in 60 years.

Let\u2019s take a look at the concepts, uses and evolution of this key technology in the computing revolution.\n\n### What is quantum computing?\n\nThis branch of computer science is **based on the principles of the superposition of matter and quantum entanglement and uses a different computation method from the traditional one.** In theory, it would be able to store many more states per unit of information and operate with much more efficient algorithms at the numerical level, such as Shor's or quantum annealing.\n\nThis new generation of supercomputers uses knowledge of quantum mechanics \u2014 the area of physics that studies atomic and subatomic particles \u2014 to overcome the limitations of classic computing. Although in practice, quantum computing faces evident problems regarding scalability and incoherence, **it makes it possible to perform multiple simultaneous operations and eliminates the tunnel effect that limits current nanometric scale programming.**\n\n### What is a qubit?\n\nA qubit (or quantum bit) is the **basic unit of information in a quantum computer, equivalent to the bit in classical computing.** Unlike a traditional bit, which can only be in one of two states\u20140 or 1\u2014a qubit can be in a superposition of both states at the same time, thanks to quantum mechanics. This means that a qubit can simultaneously represent 0 and 1, allowing quantum computers to process much more information at the same time. Qubits can also be entangled, so that the state of one depends on the state of the other, further enhancing the computing power of quantum systems.\n\nThis multiplicity of states makes it possible for a quantum computer with just 30 qubits, for example, to perform 10 billion floating-point operations per second, which is about 5.8 billion more than the most powerful PlayStation video game console on the market.\u00a0One of the main differences with classical physics is that its **results are probabilistic** rather than deterministic.\n\n[#### What is Artificial Intelligence?](/about-us/our-innovation-model/what-is-artificial-intelligence)\n\nAI is set to bring about a revolution on a par with the Internet.\n\n[#### History of artificial intelligence](/about-us/our-innovation-model/history-artificial-intelligence)\n\nGet to know the almost century-old set of conceptions behind artificial intelligence.\n\n[#### AI Algorithms](/about-us/our-innovation-model/algorithms-ia)\n\nGet an insight into the diversity of algorithms that make up AI.\n\n### Differences between quantum and traditional computing\n\nQuantum computing and traditional computing are two parallel worlds with some similarities and numerous differences between them, such as the use of qubits versus bits. Here are some of the most relevant ones:\n\nComputing power\n\nIn quantum computers, processing power grows exponentially as qubits are added, thanks to properties such as superposition (a qubit can represent several values at once) and entanglement (qubits can be connected to each other so that they act as a single system). This means that with each additional qubit, the system can handle twice as many possible combinations, multiplying its computing power. In contrast, in classical computing, computing power grows linearly: adding more transistors (the components that process information) improves performance, but each one only adds one more unit of capacity.\n\nProgramming language\n\nQuantum computing does not have its own programming code and requires the development and implementation of very specific algorithms. However, traditional computing has standardised languages like Java, SQL and Python, to name but a few.\n\nFunctionality\n\nQuantum computers are not intended for widespread, everyday use, unlike personal computers (PC). These supercomputers are so complex that they can only be used in the corporate, scientific and technological fields.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe composition of a quantum computer is different from that of a conventional one, and it has no memory or processor. Quantum computers are composed of a set of qubits which, thanks to superposition (0 and 1) and entanglement, enable a quantum computer to test all paths at the same time, finding the answer much faster.\n\nError rate\n\nWhile traditional computers operate with extremely high precision and almost negligible errors thanks to mature technologies and highly efficient error correction systems, quantum computers still have relatively high error rates. This loss of quantum coherence (called decoherence) is due to the fact that qubits are very sensitive to external disturbances such as heat, noise and vibrations, which can alter their quantum state and cause calculation errors.\n\n### The quantum leap in **computing**\n\nThe truth about quantum computers\n\nQuantum computing **uses superconducting *qubits*** to exponentially boost computing speed.\n\nBuilding bigger quantum systems\n\n**Linear *qubit* segments** have been replaced by four superconducting *qubits* on a one-quarter-square-inch chip.\n\nStopping and minimising quantum errors\n\nExposure to heat makes qubits more error-prone, but we already know **how to identify *bit-flip* and *phase-flip* errors**.\n\nUses for quantum computers\n\nComputing will improve big data analysis, the **development of new drugs and materials**, machine learning and cryptography, etc.\n\nSource: TechTarget.\n\n[SEE INFOGRAPHIC: The quantum leap in computing [PDF]](/documents/20125/40168/salto-cuantico-computacion-746-EN.pdf/505ea16b-ef6d-df9b-f34d-cd3edbc2ddd4?t=1752840115562 \" External link, opens in new window.\")\n\n### Operating conditions of a quantum computer\n\nThese computers are extremely sensitive and require very specific pressure and temperature conditions and insulation to operate correctly. **When these machines interact with external particles, measurement errors and the erasure of state overlaps occur,** which is why they are sealed and have to be operated using conventional computers.\n\n**Quantum computers must have almost no atmospheric pressure, an ambient temperature close to absolute zero (-273\u00b0C) and insulation from the earth's magnetic field** to prevent the atoms from moving, colliding with each other, or interacting with the environment. In addition, these systems only operate for very short intervals of time, so that the information becomes damaged and cannot be stored, making it even more difficult to recover the data.\n\n### Main uses of quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing offers new opportunities for solving problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computing resources. These possibilities can be grouped into four areas:\n\n* **Simulation.** With improvements in R&D&I simulation in medicine, chemistry and the agri-food industry; in complex financial models; in weather forecasting; and in the science and design of new materials.\n* **Artificial intelligence.** Quantum computing enables the execution of advanced machine learning models or large language models, among others.\n* **Optimisation.** This technology enables better management and measurement of, for example, traffic and smart cities, real-time supply chains, and distribution and telecommunications networks.\n* **Cryptography.** With the evolution of data encryption methods and new secure transmission methods.\n\nAll in all, some of the main applications of classical computing are:\n\nFinance\n\nQuantum computing can transform finance by enabling much faster and more accurate optimisation of investment portfolios, analysing multiple variables and scenarios simultaneously to maximise returns and reduce risk. It also improves fraud detection by identifying complex patterns and anomalies in large volumes of data in real time, and facilitates advanced financial simulations.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThis sector would benefit from the development of new drugs and genetically customised treatments, as well as DNA research.\u00a0Quantum sensors can also detect minute changes in the human body, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses of diseases such as cancer. They also improve medical imaging with high-resolution images at the molecular level, significantly enhancing the quality of magnetic resonance imaging and other methods.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe power of quantum computers could jeopardise traditional encryption systems, as they would be capable of breaking codes that are currently considered inviolable. However, at the same time, quantum computing is driving revolutionary advances in data protection, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This innovative method uses light signals to transmit encryption keys extremely securely, as any attempt at interception alters the state of the quantum particles and can be detected immediately.\n\nMobility and transport\n\nQuantum computing enables the design of more efficient means of transport, a method already used by Airbus in the conceptualisation and development of aircraft. In addition, qubits will enable significant advances in traffic planning and route optimisation systems. Quantum sensors also improve the accuracy of navigation systems, especially in places where GPS signals are weak or non-existent, such as in space or underwater.\n\n### quantumco computing in the **energy industry**\n\n**quantumco computing** is beginning to open up new possibilities in the **energy industry**, offering tools to optimise **grid management**, improve **system efficiency** and accelerate the **development of clean tech**. Here are some of the new possibilities:\n\n[SEE INFOGRAPHIC: Quantum computing in the energy industry [PDF]](https://www.iberdrola.com/documents/20125/40168/infografia-computacion-cuantica-sector-energetico-EN.pdf)\n\n### What's the current state of quantum computing?\n\nQuantum computing is at a technological turning point.\u00a0This status can be measured using the QTRL (Quantum Technology Readiness Level), a scale that measures the maturity level of quantum computing technologies. The scale has nine levels, with QTRL1 the lowest level of technological readiness and QTRL9 the highest. Most quantum computing technologies today are at intermediate levels on the QTRL scale, generally between QTRL3 and QTRL5.\n\nThe US, China and Europe are at the forefront of quantum computing development in terms of both technology and investment. They are followed by Australia, Japan and Singapore which are also important hubs in the drive towards quantum computing. Among the main global players, the following stand out:\n\n* **Google.** Google's latest quantum chip, Willow, with 105 qubits, has proven capable of significantly reducing errors as it scales. Its core technology is quantum annealing.\n* **IBM.** Since Quantum System One, it has focused on quantum computers for commercial purposes, such as the IBM Quantum System Two, located in Yorktown Heights, New York, designed to be modular and flexible. The modular approach allows for scalability and adaptability, critical aspects for the evolution of quantum computing infrastructure.\n\n### Our innovation model\n\n[Read more](/innovation/our-innovation-model)\n\n### Quantum computing initiatives Iberdrola is involved in\n\nAt Iberdrola, we are exploring the potential of quantum computing to transform the energy management of the future, especially in the field of smart grids.
