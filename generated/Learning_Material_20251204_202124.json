      "explanation": "Reinforcement learning (RL) differs from supervised learning because it doesn't require labeled data. Instead, an agent explores the environment and learns which actions lead to the most reward over time. Think of a dog learning tricks - it gets treats (rewards) for performing the trick correctly.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Linear Regression aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values. This allows for making predictions about future data points based on the learned linear relationship. It is a supervised learning algorithm because it learns from labeled data (input features and corresponding target values).",

      "front": "Explain the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks and describe a strategy to mitigate it.",
      "back": "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, preventing weights in earlier layers from updating effectively. This is often caused by activation functions with gradients that saturate at 0 (e.g., sigmoid, tanh). Mitigation strategies include using ReLU or Leaky ReLU activation functions (which don't saturate as easily), batch normalization (which normalizes activations), and skip connections (e.g., in ResNets) that allow gradients to bypass layers.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "The vanishing gradient problem is a significant obstacle in training deep networks. Understanding its cause and the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies is crucial for building successful deep learning models. ReLU and skip connections directly address the issue of diminishing gradients, while batch normalization helps stabilize training and allows for higher learning rates.",
