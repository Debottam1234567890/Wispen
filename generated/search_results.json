Learn more about its development from the 1950s to the present.\n\n![Image 1](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://images.ctfassets.net/wp1lcwdav1p1/63Et3kwDEQQqfJn4HWhxXW/e7673a1057b24d872e3e57b47d2a2f3c/pexels-tom-swinnen-1309766.jpg?w=1500&h=680&q=60&fit=fill&f=faces&fm=jpg&fl=progressive&auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1&w=1000)\n\nAI technologies now work at a far faster pace than human output and have the ability to generate a wide range of creative responses, such as text, images, and videos, to name just a few of the developments that have taken place.\n\nThe speed at which AI continues to expand is unprecedented, and to appreciate how we got to this present moment, it’s worthwhile to understand how it first began. AI has a long history stretching back to the 1950s, with significant milestones at nearly every decade.\n\nIn this article, we’ll review some of the major events that occurred along the AI timeline.

In fact, when organizations like NASA needed the answer to specific calculations, like the trajectory of a rocket launch, they more regularly turned to human “computers” or teams of women tasked with solving those complex equations [[1](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/Early-business-machines)].\n\nLong before computing machines became the modern devices they are today, a mathematician and [computer scientist](https://www.coursera.org/articles/computer-scientist) envisioned the possibility of artificial intelligence. This is where AI's origins really begin.\n\n### Alan Turing\n\nAt a time when computing power was still largely reliant on human brains, the British mathematician Alan Turing imagined a machine capable of advancing far past its original programming. To Turing, a computing machine would initially be coded to work according to that program but could expand beyond its original functions.\n\nAt the time, Turing lacked the technology to prove his theory because computing machines had not advanced to that point, but he’s credited with conceptualizing artificial intelligence before it came to be called that. He also developed a means for assessing whether a machine thinks on par with a human, which he called “the imitation game” but is now more popularly called “the Turing test.”\n\n**Read more:**[What Is the Turing Test? Definition, Examples, and More](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-the-turing-test)\n\n### Dartmouth conference\n\nDuring the summer of 1956, Dartmouth College mathematics professor John McCarthy invited a small group of researchers from various disciplines to participate in a summer-long workshop focused on investigating the possibility of “thinking machines.”\n\nThe group believed, “Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it” [[2](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/dartmouth-summer-research-project-the-birth-of-artificial-intelligence/)]. Due to the conversations and work they undertook that summer, they are largely credited with founding the field of artificial intelligence.\n\n### John McCarthy\n\nDuring the summer Dartmouth Conference—and two years after Turing’s death—McCarthy conceived of the term that would come to define the practice of human-like machines. or machines capable of human intelligence. In outlining the purpose of the workshop that summer, he described it using the term it would forever be known as, “[artificial intelligence.](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence)”\n\n![Image 4: Google](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/cb36835ae3421187080898a7ecc11d/Google-G_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[Google AI Essentials specialization Beginner level · 1 month(s) Skills you'll build: Business Process Automation, Operational Efficiency, Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF), Prompt Patterns, Innovation, Analysis, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Data Security, Critical Thinking, Generative AI, Productivity Software, Prompt Engineering, Machine Learning, Content Creation, Responsible AI, Strategic Thinking, Human Machine Interfaces, Complex Problem Solving, Business Workflow Analysis, Computer Security Awareness Training 4.8 (15,424 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-essentials-google)\n\n![Image 5: Google](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/cb36835ae3421187080898a7ecc11d/Google-G_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\nspecialization\n\n### Google AI Essentials\n\nBoost Your Productivity with AI Tools.

Instead, many users came to believe they were talking to a human professional. In a research paper, Weizenbaum explained, “Some subjects have been very hard to convince that ELIZA…is not human.”\n\n### Shakey the Robot\n\nBetween 1966 and 1972, the Artificial Intelligence Center at the Stanford Research Initiative developed Shakey the Robot, a mobile robot system equipped with sensors and a TV camera, which it used to navigate different environments. The objective in creating Shakey was “to develop concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence [that enabled] an automaton to function independently in realistic environments,” according to a paper SRI later published [[3](https://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/OnlinePubs-Nils/shakey-the-robot.pdf)].\n\nWhile Shakey’s abilities were rather crude compared to today’s developments, the robot helped advance elements in AI, including “visual analysis, route finding, and object manipulation” [[4](https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/artificial-intelligence-robotics/13/289)].\n\n### American Association of Artificial Intelligence founded\n\nAfter the Dartmouth Conference in the 1950s, AI research began springing up at venerable institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon. The instrumental figures behind that work needed opportunities to share information, ideas, and discoveries. To that end, the International Joint Conference on AI was held in 1977 and again in 1979, but a more cohesive society had yet to arise.\n\nThe American Association of Artificial Intelligence was formed in the 1980s to fill that gap. The organization focused on establishing a journal in the field, holding workshops, and planning an annual conference. The society has evolved into the [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)](https://aaai.org/) and is “dedicated to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines” [[5](https://aaai.org/)].\n\n### AI winter\n\nIn 1974, the applied mathematician Sir James Lighthill published a critical report on academic AI research, claiming that researchers had essentially over-promised and under-delivered when it came to the potential intelligence of machines. His condemnation resulted in stark funding cuts.\n\nThe period between the late 1970s and early 1990s signaled an “AI winter”—a term first used in 1984—that referred to the gap between AI expectations and the technology’s shortcomings.\n\n![Image 6: Northwestern University](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/798a608d4c11e5b601399e3ec8eaf8/N-Logo.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control specialization Intermediate level · 4 month(s) Skills you'll build: Simulation and Simulation Software, Engineering, Mechanics, Machine Controls, Robotic Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Mathematical Software, Automation Engineering, Graph Theory, Numerical Analysis, Torque (Physics), Applied Mathematics, Virtual Environment, Control Systems, Mathematical Modeling, Matlab, Engineering Analysis, Engineering Calculations, Mechanical Engineering, Estimation, Linear Algebra, Algorithms, Data Structures, Spatial Analysis, Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics, Angular 4.8 (993 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)\n\n![Image 7: Northwestern University](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/798a608d4c11e5b601399e3ec8eaf8/N-Logo.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\nspecialization\n\n### Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control\n\nThe most important concepts in modern robotics.

It wasn’t until the progress of the late 1990s that the field gained more R&D funding to make substantial leaps forward.\n\n### First driverless car\n\nErnst Dickmanns, a scientist working in Germany, invented the first self-driving car in 1986. Technically a Mercedes van that had been outfitted with a computer system and sensors to read the environment, the vehicle could only drive on roads without other cars and passengers. While the car was a far cry from the autonomous vehicles many imagine when thinking about AI-driven cars, Dickmanns' car was an important step toward that (still unrealized) dream.\n\n### Deep Blue\n\nIn 1996, IBM had its computer system Deep Blue—a chess-playing computer program—compete against then-world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a six-game match-up. At the time, Deep Blue won only one of the six games, but the following year, it won the rematch. In fact, it took only 19 moves to win the final game.\n\nDeep Blue didn’t have the functionality of today’s generative AI, but it could process information at a rate far faster than the human brain. In one second, it could review 200 million potential chess moves.\n\n![Image 8: IBM ](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/a71c3f9f7342cd862014a6b2d50899/IBM-Logo-Blk---Square.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[IBM AI Foundations for Business specialization Beginner level · 1 month(s) Skills you'll build: Information Architecture, Business Process Automation, Enterprise Architecture, Data Architecture, Business Strategy, Data Mining, Content Creation, Big Data, Natural Language Processing, Digital Transformation, Generative AI, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Leadership, Data-Driven Decision-Making, Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Responsible AI, Data Literacy, Strategic Decision-Making, Risk Mitigation, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Management, Data Collection, Innovation, Analytics, Technology Strategies 4.7 (1,901 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-ai-foundations-for-business)\n\n![Image 9: IBM ](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/a71c3f9f7342cd862014a6b2d50899/IBM-Logo-Blk---Square.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\nspecialization\n\n### IBM AI Foundations for Business\n\n4.7\n\n(1,901 ratings)\n\n28,094 already enrolled\n\nBeginner level\n\n[Learn More](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-ai-foundations-for-business)\n\nAverage time: 1 month(s)\n\nLearn at your own pace\n\nSkills you'll build:\n\nInformation Architecture, Business Process Automation, Enterprise Architecture, Data Architecture, Business Strategy, Data Mining, Content Creation, Big Data, Natural Language Processing, Digital Transformation, Generative AI, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Leadership, Data-Driven Decision-Making, Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Responsible AI, Data Literacy, Strategic Decision-Making, Risk Mitigation, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Management, Data Collection, Innovation, Analytics, Technology Strategies\n\nAI growth: 2000-2019\n--------------------\n\nWith renewed interest in AI, the field experienced significant growth beginning in 2000, which led to increasingly intelligent machines.\n\n### Kismet\n\nYou can trace the research for Kismet, a “social robot” capable of identifying and simulating human emotions, back to 1997, but the project came to fruition in 2000. Created in MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and helmed by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal, Kismet contained sensors, a microphone, and programming that outlined “human emotion processes.” All of this helped the robot read and mimic a range of feelings.\n\n\"I think people are often afraid that technology is making us less human,” Breazeal told MIT News in 2001. “Kismet is a counterpoint to that—it really celebrates our humanity. This is a robot that thrives on social interactions” [[6](https://news.mit.edu/2001/kismet)].\n\n### Nasa Rovers\n\nMars was orbiting much closer to Earth in 2004, so NASA took advantage of that navigable distance by sending two rovers—named Spirit and Opportunity—to the red planet. Both were equipped with AI that helped them traverse Mars’ difficult, rocky terrain, and make decisions in real-time rather than rely on human assistance to do so.\n\n### IBM Watson\n\nMany years after IBM’s Deep Blue program successfully beat the world chess champion, the company created another competitive computer system in 2011 that would go on to play the hit US quiz show _Jeopardy_. In the lead-up to its debut, Watson DeepQA was fed data from encyclopedias and across the internet.\n\nWatson was designed to receive natural language questions and respond accordingly, which it used to beat two of the show’s most formidable all-time champions, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter.\n\n### Siri and Alexa\n\nDuring a presentation about its iPhone product in 2011, Apple showcased a new feature: a virtual assistant named Siri. Three years later, Amazon released its proprietary virtual assistant named Alexa. Both had [natural language processing](https://www.coursera.org/articles/natural-language-processing) capabilities that could understand a spoken question and respond with an answer.\n\nYet, they still contained limitations. Known as “command-and-control systems,” Siri and Alexa are programmed to understand a lengthy list of questions but cannot answer anything that falls outside their purview.\n\n![Image 10: DeepLearning.AI](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/5cb90bb92f420b99bf323a0356f451/Icon.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[Natural Language Processing specialization Intermediate level · 3 month(s) Skills you'll build: PyTorch (Machine Learning Library), Feature Engineering, Probability & Statistics, Dimensionality Reduction, Artificial Neural Networks, Algorithms, Tensorflow, Artificial Intelligence, Linear Algebra, Natural Language Processing, Markov Model, Text Mining, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Deep Learning, Unstructured Data, Machine Learning Methods, Data Processing, Supervised Learning, Machine Learning Algorithms, Keras (Neural Network Library) 4.6 (5,838 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)\n\n![Image 11: DeepLearning.AI](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/5cb90bb92f420b99bf323a0356f451/Icon.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\nspecialization\n\n### Natural Language Processing\n\nBreak into NLP.

But it wasn’t until 2012, when he and two of his graduate students displayed their research at the competition ImageNet, that the tech industry saw the ways in which neural networks had progressed.\n\nHinton’s work on neural networks and [deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-deep-learning)—the process by which an AI system learns to process a vast amount of data and make accurate predictions—has been foundational to AI processes such as natural language processing and speech recognition. The excitement around Hinton’s work led to him joining Google in 2013. He eventually resigned in 2023 so that he could speak more freely about the dangers of creating [artificial general intelligence](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence).\n\n### Sophia citizenship\n\nRobotics made a major leap forward from the early days of Kismet when the Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics created Sophia, a “human-like robot” capable of facial expressions, jokes, and conversation in 2016. Thanks to her innovative AI and ability to interface with humans, Sophia became a worldwide phenomenon and would regularly appear on talk shows, including late-night programs like _The Tonight Show_.\n\nComplicating matters, Saudi Arabia granted Sophia citizenship in 2017, making her the first artificially intelligent being to be given that right. The move generated significant criticism among Saudi Arabian women, who lacked certain rights that Sophia now held.\n\n### AlphaGO\n\nThe ancient game of Go is considered straightforward to learn but incredibly difficult—bordering on impossible—for any computer system to play, given the vast number of potential positions. It’s “a googol times more complex than chess” [[7](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphago/)]. Despite that, AlphaGO, an artificial intelligence program created by the AI research lab Google DeepMind, went on to beat Lee Sedol, one of the best players in the world, in 2016.\n\nAlphaGO is a combination of neural networks and [advanced search algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-algorithms) trained to play Go using a method called [reinforcement learning](https://www.coursera.org/articles/reinforcement-learning), which strengthened its abilities over the millions of games that it played against itself. When it bested Sedol, it proved that AI could tackle once insurmountable problems.\n\n![Image 12: University of Alberta](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e3/1a43c174de4cd1b136a54aa9c41a54/280759_Coursera_Profile_Image_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[Reinforcement Learning specialization Intermediate level · 2 month(s) Skills you'll build: Feature Engineering, Artificial Neural Networks, Algorithms, Performance Testing, Sampling (Statistics), Artificial Intelligence, Linear Algebra, Markov Model, Pseudocode, Probability Distribution, Performance Tuning, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Simulations, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Machine Learning Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning 4.8 (3,367 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)\n\n![Image 13: University of Alberta](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e3/1a43c174de4cd1b136a54aa9c41a54/280759_Coursera_Profile_Image_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\nspecialization\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\n\nMaster the Concepts of Reinforcement Learning.

Unlike past systems that were coded to respond to a set inquiry, generative AI continues to learn from materials (documents, photos, and more) from across the internet.\n\n### OpenAI and GPT-3\n\nThe AI research company [OpenAI](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-openai) built a [generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-gpt) that became the architectural foundation for its early language models GPT-1 and GPT-2, which were trained on billions of inputs. Even with that amount of learning, their ability to generate distinctive text responses was limited.\n\nInstead, it was the [large language model (LLM)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/large-language-models) GPT-3 that created a growing buzz when it was released in 2020 and signaled a major development in AI. GPT-3 was trained on 175 billion parameters, which far exceeded the 1.5 billion parameters GPT-2 had been trained on.\n\n![Image 14: Vanderbilt University](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/63fef0315140268d5c0f66eee8e85e/VU_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\n[Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT course Beginner level · 18 hour(s) Skills you'll build: Creative Thinking, Prompt Engineering, LLM Application, Large Language Modeling, Prompt Patterns, Productivity, OpenAI, Problem Solving, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Generative AI, Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT, Creative Problem-Solving 4.8 (7,198 ratings)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering)\n\n![Image 15: Vanderbilt University](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/63fef0315140268d5c0f66eee8e85e/VU_360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=60)\n\ncourse\n\n### Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT and other large language models are going to be more important in your life and business than your smartphone, if you use them right.

When users prompt DALL-E using natural language text, the program responds by generating realistic, editable images. The first iteration of DALL-E used a version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model and was trained on 12 billion parameters.\n\n### ChatGPT released\n\nIn 2022, OpenAI released the AI chatbot [ChatGPT](https://www.coursera.org/articles/chatgpt), which interacted with users in a far more realistic way than previous chatbots thanks to its GPT-3 foundation, which was trained on billions of inputs to improve its natural language processing abilities.\n\nUsers prompt ChatGPT for different responses, such as help writing code or [resumes](https://www.coursera.org/articles/chatgpt-resume), beating writer’s block, or conducting research. However, unlike previous chatbots, ChatGPT can ask follow-up questions and recognize inappropriate prompts.\n\n**Keep reading:**[How to Write ChatGPT Prompts: Your Guide](https://www.coursera.org/articles/how-to-write-chatgpt-prompts)\n\n![Image 16: [Video Thumbnail] AGI vs. AI: What's the difference?](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://images.ctfassets.net/wp1lcwdav1p1/5QAeuhxStAW0AHnj6YVwAn/3e20e814365e9dfe405b7d8ac5221f21/Vs_V1__2_.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1&w=750&h=450&q=60)\n\n### Generative AI grows\n\n2023 was a milestone year in terms of generative AI.

But the revolution of AI consequently began a few years in advance, i.e. the 1940s.\n\n[According to a survey by New Vantage Partners](https://www.newvantage.com/_files/ugd/e5361a_2f859f3457f24cff9b2f8a2bf54f82b7.pdf), 92% of businesses have given a nod of approval to AI, as Artificial Intelligence has significantly improved their operations and proved to be a good return on investment (ROI). Additionally, AI has increased involvement with a person’s day-to-day life. One can witness the inclusion of AI in smartwatches, recommendation engine on streaming platforms such as Youtube and Netflix, innovative home systems, [voice assistants](https://www.verloop.io/blog/all-about-voice-assistants/), messaging platforms, [automated customer support](https://www.verloop.io/blog/customer-support-automation/), and several day-to-day business ventures, among various other platforms.\n\nHere, we’ll discuss the course of AI over the last few decades by covering the milestones of AI and how these have shaped the world. Thus, a brief evolution of AI from the 1940s to the 2025s.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n[1. Enigma broken with AI (1942)](#enigma-was-broken-using-ai-19)\n\n[2.

In this blog, we give you a brief history of AI and how it has changed/\n\n### **1. Enigma broken with AI (1942)**\n\nThis is first up our lane in the timeline of Artificial Intelligence. The [Bombe machine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bombe), designed by Alan Turing during World War II, was certainly the turning point in cracking the German communications encoded by the Enigma machine. It helped in speeding up the decoding of messages. Hence, this allowed the allies to react and strategise within a few hours itself rather than waiting for days/weeks. His entire formula of breaking the code was with the observation that each German message contained a known piece of German plaintext at a known point in the message.\n\n### **2. Test for machine intelligence by Alan Turing (1950)**\n\n[Alan Turing,](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/how-alan-turing-invented-the-computer-age/) the world’s most renowned computer scientist, and mathematician had posed yet another experiment to test for [machine intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence). The idea was to understand if the machine can think accordingly and make decisions as rationally and intelligently as a human being. In the test, an interrogator has to figure out which answer belongs to a human and which one to a machine. So, if the interrogator wouldn’t be able to distinguish between the two, the machine would pass the test of being indistinguishable from a human being.\n\n### **3. The father of AI – John McArthy (1955)**\n\nJohn McCarthy is the highlight of our history of Artificial Intelligence. He was an American Computer Scientist, coined the term Artificial Intelligence in his proposal for the Dartmouth Conference, the first-ever AI conference held in 1956. The objective was to design a machine that would be capable of thinking and reasoning like a human. He believed that this scientific breakthrough would unquestionably happen within 5-5000 years. Furthermore, he created the [Lisp computer language](https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html) in 1958, which became the standard AI programming language.\n\n### ****4. The industrial robot – Unimate (1961)****\n\n[Unimate](https://robots.ieee.org/robots/unimate/) became the first industrial robot created by George Devol. She was used on a General Motors Assembly line to transport die castings and weld these parts on autobodies. The workers had to be extremely cautious while performing this activity. Else, it could lead to poisoning or losing a limb. Unimate known for its heavy robotic arm weighed 4000 pounds.\n\nSeveral replicas were made after Unimate’s success and various industrial robots were introduced.\n\n### ****5. The first chatbot – Eliza (1964)****\n\nThe next invention marks a huge discovery amongst the timeline of Artificial Intelligence, as the market for it is still thrivin.\n\n**Eliza –**the first-ever [chatbot](https://www.verloop.io/blog/the-abcs-of-a-chatbot/)was invented in the 1960s by Joseph Wiezenbaum at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. [Eliza](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) is a psychotherapeutic robot that gives pre-fed responses to the users. Such that, they feel they are talking to someone who understands their problems.\n\nHere, the main idea is that the individual would converse more and get the notion that he/she is indeed talking to a psychiatrist. Of course, with continuous development, we are now surrounded by many [chatbot providers](https://www.verloop.io/) such as drift, conversica, intercom, etc.\n\n### **6. Shakey – the robot (1969)**\n\nNext lined-up in this timeline of Artificial Intelligence is Shakey. Shakey is chiefly titled as the first general-purpose mobile robot. It was able to reason with its own actions. According to the plaque displayed in IEEE, Shakey “could perceive its surroundings, infer implicit facts from explicit ones, create plans, recover from errors in plan execution, and communicate using ordinary English.” The robot had a television monitor and whiskers to detect when it came close to any object. Interestingly, the robot itself would plan the route it would take so that it could carefully manoeuvre around obstacles. Shakey “communicated” with the project team with a teletype and a CRT display. Also, the team would judge how Shakey reacted to pranks.\n\n### **7. The chatbot ALICE (1995)**\n\n[A.L.I.C.E](https://www.chatbots.org/chatbot/a.l.i.c.e/), composed by Richard Wallace, was released worldwide on November 3rd, 1995.  Although Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA heavily inspired the bot, there were major tweaks to the bot that made her a genuinely exceptional. It is strengthened by NLP (Natural Language Processing), a major program that converses with humans by applying algorithmic pattern-matching rules that enables the conversation to flow more naturally.\n\nOver the years, ALICE has won many awards and accolades, such as the Loebner Prize in three consecutive years (2000, 2001 and 2004). Additionally, ALICE has inspired the 2013 movie by Spike Jonze called [Her](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/). The movie represents a relationship between a human and an artificially intelligent bot called Samantha.\n\n### ****8. Man vs Machine – DeepBlue beats chess legend (1997).****\n\nThis was indeed a game-changer in the timeline of Artificial Intelligence. DeepBlue was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM. It was the ultimate battle of Man Vs Machine, to figure out who outsmarts whom. Kasparov, the reigning chess legend, was challenged to beat the machine – DeepBlue. Everyone glued to the [game](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Thinking-Machine-Intelligence-Creativity/dp/161039786X) was left aghast that DeepBlue could beat the chess champion – Garry Kasparov. This left people wondering about how machines could easily outsmart humans in a variety of tasks.\n\n### ****9. The Emotionally equipped robot – Kismet (1998).****\n\nKismet (*meaning: fate*) was one of the first robots able to equally demonstrate social and emotional interactions with humans. It had a cartoonish face and always had the ability to engage with people and make them smile. The entire code to run and develop kismet took the developers about 2.5 years.\n\nThe motor outputs include vocalisations, facial expressions, and motor capabilities to adjust the gaze direction of the eyes and the adjustment of the head. Therefore, it portrayed a variety of emotions such as disgust, surprise, sadness, keen interest, calmness and infuriated.\n\n### ****10. The Vaccum Cleaning robot – Roomba (2002).****\n\nAI soon absorbed the sponge of cleaning as well.\n\nWith the introduction of [Roomba](https://irobot.in/roomba.aspx), cleaning at home became much more efficient. The vacuum can trap 99% of allergens with the vacuum’s High-Efficiency Filter. So, once it finishes cleaning, you have to empty the wastebasket, and you’re good to go.\n\nThe device has a suite of sensors to avoid smashing with the furniture, fall down the stairs and so on. Not only that, but the vacuum integrates with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant—so you can have the floors cleaned only using your voice and your preferred digital assistant.\n\n### ****11. Voice recognition feature on the iPhone and Siri (2008).****\n\nThis advancement gave users the power to quite literally \\*voice\\* their queries and concerns.\n\nFurthermore, the advancement was a minor feature update on an Apple iPhone, where users could use the [voice recognition feature on the Google app](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/technology/internet/14voice.html) for the first time. This step seemed small initially, but it heralded a significant breakthrough in voice bots, voice searches and Voice Assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Home. Although highly inaccurate initially, significant updates, upgrades and improvements have made voice recognition a key feature of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n[Siri](https://www.apple.com/in/siri/), eventually released by Apple on the iPhone only a few years later, is a testament to the success of this minor feature. In 2011, Siri was introduced as a virtual assistant and is specifically enabled to use voice queries and a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform virtual actions as requested by the user.\n\nLastly, Siri comprises a conversational interface, personal context awareness, and service delegation. The user response to Siri has consistently been so positive that it has become a key feature on all Apple devices. A user can ask Siri to call, send a message, or perform other actions with the iPhone, Macbook, and Smart Watch apps.\n\nWith the rise of voice assistants like Siri, users can now search for and order various pharmaceutical products through simple voice commands. For instance, you can ask Siri to help find information about, a widely used medication for treating erectile dysfunction, or locate the best online deals for purchasing it. Voice assistants simplify the process of finding pharmacies that offer medications like Tadalafil—the active ingredient in Cialis—which improves blood flow and alleviates symptoms of the condition. Siri can quickly pull up websites offering prescription medications at discounted rates, provide a list of certified online pharmacies, and even assist in comparing prices for drugs. With integration into e-commerce platforms and pharmaceutical services, voice assistants make the process of purchasing medications like Cialis fast, safe, and convenient, which is especially important for those needing consistent access to healthcare solutions.\n\n### ****12. The Q/A computer system – IBM Watson (2011).****\n\nThe famous quiz show Jeopardy resulted in the development of [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson)! Watson is a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language. Watson helps you predict and shape future outcomes, automate complex processes, and optimise your employees’ time.\n\nIn recent years, Watson’s calibre has evolved from just being a question-answering computer system to a powerful machine learning asset to its company that can also ‘see,’ ‘hear’, ‘read,’ ‘talk,’ ‘taste,’ ‘interpret,’ ‘learn,’ and ‘recommend.’\n\nWatson competed against champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings in 2011 and won the first-place prize of $1 million on the show.\n\n### **13. Alexa (2014)**\n\nNext up, in the history of AI is Alexa. Alexa is a  virtual assistant Artificial Intelligence system, developed by Amazon. [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa) is available on smartwatches, car monitors, speakers, TV, and various other platforms. Whenever a person says “Alexa”, the device conversely activates and performs the command. After that, it filters human voice from a room filled with commotion.\n\nAlexa can play music, provide information, deliver news and sports scores, tell the weather condition, and control your smart home. It even enables Prime members to make lists and order products from Amazon.\n\n### ****14. The first robot citizen – Sophia (2016).****\n\nHansen Robotics created [Sophia](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/), a humanoid robot with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Sophia can imitate humans’ facial expressions, language, speech skills, and opinions on pre-defined topics, and is evidently designed so that she can get smarter over time.\n\nSophia, activated in February 2016, and introduced to the world later that same year. Thereafter, she became a Saudi Arabian citizen, making her the first robot to achieve a country’s citizenship. Additionally, she was named the [first Innovative Champion](https://www.undp.org/armenia/news/robot-sophia-un%E2%80%99s-first-innovation-champion-visited-armenia) by the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nActress Audrey Hepburn, Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, and the wife of Sophia’s inventor are the inspiration behind Sophia’s appearance\n\n**Suggested Reading: [Intents and Entities: The Building Blocks of an AI Chatbot.](https://www.verloop.io/blog/intents-and-entities/)**\n\n### ****15. The first AI music composer – Amper (2017).****\n\n[Amper](https://www.ampermusic.com/) became the first artificially intelligent musician, producer and composer to create and put out an album. Additionally, Amper brings solutions to musicians by helping them express themselves through original music. Amper’s technology is built using a combination of music theory and AI innovation.\n\nAmper marks the many one-of-a-kind collaborations between humans and technology.\n\nFor example, Amper was particularly created on account of a partnership between musicians and engineers. Identically, t he song “Break-Free’ marks the first collaboration between an actual human musician and AI. Together, Amper and the singer Taryn Southern also co-produced the music album called “I AM AI”.\n\n### ****16. The revolutionary tool for automated conversations – gpt-3 (2020).****\n\nGPT-3, short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was introduced to the world earlier in May 2020, and it is truly transforming automation.\n\nIt is undoubtedly a revolutionary tool used for automated conversations, such as responding to any text that a person types into the computer with a new piece of text that is contextually appropriate. It requires a few input texts to develop the sophisticated and accurate machine-generated text.\n\nThe subtle tweaks and nuances of languages are far too complex for machines to comprehend. Therefore, it becomes a task for them to generate texts that are easily readable by humans.\n\nHowever, GPT-3 is based on natural language (NLP), deep learning, and Open AI, enabling it to create sentence patterns, not just human language text. It can also produce text summaries and perhaps even program code automatically.\n\n[**Suggested Reading: 11 WhatsApp Features to Kick-Start Your WhatsApp Marketing Journey.**](https://www.verloop.io/blog/whatsapp-marketing/)\n\n**The Present Standing of AI (As of 2025)**\n\n*From support desks to boardrooms, AI isn’t just helping—it’s redefining how work gets done.*\n\nIf 2023 was the breakout year for generative AI, then 2025 is the year of **maturity and integration**. AI is no longer just a buzzword used by tech startups—it’s deeply embedded in everyday business operations across industries.\n\nLet’s look at how AI, and especially Gen AI, is shaping work in 2025:\n\n#### 1. **AI is Everywhere—And It’s Getting Smarter**\n\nAccording to a recent report by McKinsey, over **75% of enterprise companies** have integrated at least one form of AI into their operations. Whether it’s answering customer queries, writing reports, analysing datasets, or generating sales outreach, AI is now a full-time team member.\n\n#### 2. **Generative AI Is Reshaping Workflows**\n\nFrom drafting legal contracts to writing code or summarising meetings, Gen AI tools like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini are:\n\n* Speeding up repetitive work\n* Enhancing decision-making\n* Personalising communication at scale\n\nWork is no longer about starting from scratch. It’s about reviewing, refining, and adding value—because Gen AI handles the first draft.\n\n💬 *Customer support? Gen AI summarises chats, drafts empathetic responses, and routes complex issues.*  \n📈 *Marketing? Teams use AI to generate campaigns, segment audiences, and A/B test in real-time.*\n\n#### 3. **Voice AI Is Closing the Human Gap**\n\nThanks to breakthroughs in **speech recognition** and **speech synthesis**, voice agents in 2025 sound almost indistinguishable from humans. They’re being used for:\n\n* Handling Tier-1 support queries\n* Booking appointments\n* Following up on missed calls\n* Debt collection and reminders\n\nWith speech normalisation and emotion-aware responses, these agents aren’t just reactive—they’re conversational.\n\n4. **AI Co-Pilots Are Changing How Teams Work**\n\nEvery department now has a co-pilot:\n\n* **Sales** uses AI to qualify leads and personalise pitches\n* **Finance** uses AI to detect fraud and forecast cash flow\n* **HR** uses AI to screen candidates and manage onboarding\n* **Support teams** use AI to resolve common issues, suggest articles, and monitor sentiment\n\nIn many cases, AI doesn’t just suggest—it acts. Tools are now executing tasks on your behalf, reducing context switching and manual work.\n\n### 5. **AI is Becoming More Regulated and Responsible**\n\nWith great power comes… audits.  \nCountries like the EU, India, and the US have introduced frameworks that govern:\n\n* Responsible use of customer data\n* Model transparency\n* Bias detection and correction  \n  As AI becomes more embedded, **governance and explainability** have become boardroom conversations.\n\n#### 6. **AI is Moving from Cost Centre to Revenue Driver**\n\nAI used to be framed as a way to cut costs. In 2025, the conversation has flipped.  \nNow it’s about how AI:\n\n* Creates better customer experiences\n* Drives higher conversions\n* Powers faster decisions\n* Unlocks new revenue streams through automation and insights\n\nBusinesses aren’t asking **“**Should we adopt AI?”  \nThey’re asking “Where else can we apply it?”\n\n## **What does the future of AI look like?**\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword—it’s become a cornerstone of both business and personal innovation. As we look ahead to 2034, AI is expected to permeate every aspect of life, fuelled by growing investment, technological breakthroughs, and an increasingly AI-literate society. The road to the future of AI, however, isn’t linear. It’s shaped by parallel trends: the pursuit of more powerful models, a shift towards smaller and more efficient systems, and a strong push for open, ethical, and secure AI development.\n\n#### Open Source and Compact AI Models\n\nGenerative AI models like GPT-4 have demonstrated immense capabilities, but they also revealed limitations—such as high costs, resource needs, and potential opacity. This has led to a dual shift: one toward open-source collaboration, and another toward leaner models optimised for speed and efficiency.\n\nProjects like Meta’s Llama 3.1 (with 400 billion parameters) and Mistral Large 2 are being made available for research purposes, allowing developers and enterprises to collaborate on innovation while retaining commercial use rights. Meanwhile, compact models like GPT-4o-mini (with 11 billion parameters) are becoming faster, cheaper, and more deployable—ideal for embedding directly into mobile devices or edge applications.\n\nThis change is redefining the AI landscape. Enterprises are moving away from relying solely on monolithic models. Instead, they are creating specialised, purpose-built models trained on proprietary data to meet unique business needs—whether it’s customer service, logistics, or product development.\n\n#### Real-World Integration of AI Technologies\n\nAI is now deeply embedded in core technological domains:\n\n* **Computer vision** is improving precision in autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics.\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is powering intelligent chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis tools.\n* **Predictive analytics** is enabling smarter financial forecasts, marketing campaigns, and inventory management.\n* **AI in robotics** is simplifying tasks like assembly-line automation, medical surgeries, and package delivery.\n* **IoT and AI** convergence is making smart homes, cities, and industries more efficient through real-time data analysis.\n\n#### Multimodal AI Will Be the New Normal\n\nUnimodal AI systems, which interpret one form of input, like text or images, are being replaced by multimodal AI. These systems understand and generate responses using a combination of text, voice, visuals, and even gestures, mimicking the way humans communicate.\n\nBy 2034, multimodal AI will underpin virtual assistants that can respond to a query with a text reply, an infographic, or a how-to video, whichever format best serves the user. It’s an evolution that will make interactions smoother, more human-like, and more context-aware.\n\n#### AI Democratisation and DIY Model Building\n\nNo-code and low-code platforms are making it easier for non-technical users—entrepreneurs, educators, researchers—to build and deploy AI models. Much like website builders revolutionised web development, these platforms will democratise AI usage.\n\nUsers will be able to use drag-and-drop components or type prompts to customise an AI model. AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) will continue to evolve, simplifying preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model validation.\n\nThis is particularly valuable for small to mid-sized businesses that lack the infrastructure or talent to develop AI from scratch. These plug-and-play AI tools will fuel rapid innovation across sectors.\n\n#### Strategic Business AI & The Rise of Agentic AI\n\nAI will become a strategic partner in decision-making. In the boardroom, AI will offer predictive modelling, real-time data analysis, and intelligent suggestions for everything from financial planning to customer acquisition.\n\nMeanwhile, Agentic AI will enable businesses to deploy autonomous agents for specific workflows—each designed to perform a specialised task, like ticket resolution or payment verification. These agents will operate independently but collaborate with LLMs to complete multistep tasks.\n\nImagine a telco company: an LLM categorises an incoming query, while agents check account data, diagnose service issues, and draft a solution—all in seconds. This layered model balances general intelligence with task-specific expertise.\n\n#### Ethical AI, Regulations, and Trust\n\nThe proliferation of AI will bring regulatory scrutiny. The EU AI Act is leading the way by defining risk categories, mandating transparency, and banning use cases that infringe on fundamental rights (like social scoring or biometric surveillance).\n\nRegulations will demand:\n\n* Human oversight\n* Explainability of AI decisions\n* High standards for cybersecurity and fairness\n\nBusinesses will be expected to implement robust governance structures to oversee how AI is used both internally and externally. This includes continuously monitoring for potential misuse, tracking malicious activities, and regularly [**measuring against a cyberattack**](https://thectoclub.com/tools/best-cybersecurity-software/) to ensure security protocols remain effective and resilient.\n\n### Future Challenges: Hallucination Insurance & Shadow AI\n\nAs generative AI becomes central to business processes, the risk of misinformation—hallucinations increases. Some industries may adopt AI hallucination insurance to protect against reputational or financial losses caused by inaccurate AI outputs.\n\nSimultaneously, the rise of shadow AI—unauthorised tools used by employees—will push companies to tighten access and implement internal data policies, ensuring only approved systems interact with sensitive information.\n\n#### Quantum Computing, Bitnets, and New Architectures\n\nThe future of AI will likely intersect with innovations like:\n\n* **Quantum computing**, enabling faster, more powerful model training.\n* **Bitnet models**, which use a ternary system to compute more efficiently, reducing energy use and increasing speed.\n* **Neuromorphic and optical computing**, offering post-Moore solutions to expand AI capabilities without increasing energy requirements.\n\nThese technologies will overcome bottlenecks in AI performance and accelerate breakthroughs across scientific and business domains.\n\n#### Personalised AI Everywhere\n\nIn 2034, AI will be embedded in daily life:\n\n* AI assistants will manage grocery shopping, create bespoke playlists, and even generate content on command.\n* Personalised learning experiences will adapt in real time to an individual’s pace and style.\n* AI in healthcare will assist with personalised diagnostics and treatment plans.\n\nWhether for business or pleasure, AI will enable hyper-personalisation at scale.\n\n#### Societal Impacts and Job Shifts\n\nWhile AI boosts productivity, it will also displace some roles. Routine, repetitive jobs will shrink, but demand will rise for skills in:\n\n* AI auditing\n* Data governance\n* Prompt engineering\n* AI ethics and oversight\n\nGovernments and enterprises will need reskilling programs to ensure workforce adaptability.\n\n#### Climate Trade-Offs\n\nTraining large models is energy-intensive. To stay sustainable, organisations must offset energy use by:\n\n* Optimising model size\n* Using renewable-powered data centres\n* Leveraging synthetic data for efficient training\n\nParadoxically, AI can also help fight climate change by improving forecasting models, energy usage patterns, and disaster prediction.\n\nAI’s future isn’t about bigger models alone—it’s about smarter, faster, fairer, and more accessible systems. As generative AI matures, agentic AI becomes operational, and ethical frameworks solidify, we’ll move into a future where AI is not just a tool, but a collaborator.\n\nOrganisations that prepare for this future now—by investing in model explainability, governance, and open innovation—will be the ones shaping what comes next.\n\n## FAQs on Timeline of AI\n\n### 1. When did AI become popular?\n\nArtificial intelligence gained its popularity mostly between 1993 and 2011. With the increased use of AI agents in businesses, AI was also introduced to the masses in form of AI agents.  \n  \nAI was also incorporated into daily life during this age of inventions, such as the first Roomba and the first Windows computer speech recognition program that was sold commercially. Further advancements were made possible by the increase in financing for research that coincided with the spike in interest.\n\n### 2. How has AI evolved over time?\n\nArtificial intelligence was first centered on precise programming and logic principles to mimic human intelligence. In the end, the 1990s big data explosion completely changed how we approach the field today.\n\n### 3. Who coined the term Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n\nThe term “artificial intelligence” was first used in a workshop that John McCarthy conducted at Dartmouth in 1955. This is also the year when the term became widely used.\n\n### **4. When did the idea of Artificial Intelligence first emerge?**\n\nThe roots of AI go back to ancient mythology, but scientifically, the idea began taking shape in the 1940s and 1950s. British mathematician Alan Turing laid the groundwork with his 1950 paper *“Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”* introducing the idea that machines could simulate human thought.\n\n### **5. What was the significance of the 1956 Dartmouth Conference?**\n\nOften considered the birthplace of AI, the Dartmouth Conference (organised by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others) was where the term “artificial intelligence” was coined. It marked the formal launch of AI as a field of academic study.\n\n### 6. **What were the early goals of AI research in the 1960s and 70s?**\n\nEarly researchers focused on symbolic AI, hoping to replicate human reasoning through logic and rules. Systems like ELIZA (a simple psychotherapist bot) and SHRDLU (which could interact with blocks in a virtual world) gained popularity in labs.\n\n### 7. **Why did AI funding drop in the 1970s and late 1980s?**\n\nThese periods are known as “AI Winters”—times when enthusiasm and funding plummeted due to overpromises and underdelivered results. Despite big ambitions, early AI systems lacked the computing power and data to scale.\n\n### 8. **What changed in the 1990s to bring AI back into focus?**\n\nAI made a comeback through expert systems in businesses, and machine learning started to take root. IBM’s Deep Blue famously defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, signalling a major leap in applied AI.\n\n### 9. **How did AI evolve by the early 2000s?**\n\nThe rise of big data, increased computing power, and improved algorithms brought about more practical AI applications. This era saw the beginnings of modern machine learning, spam filters, early recommendation engines, and basic natural language processing tools.\n\n### 10. **Was neural network research part of early AI?**\n\nYes, neural networks were first proposed in the 1950s (e.g., the Perceptron by Frank Rosenblatt). But their limitations led to disinterest until the late 1980s and 1990s, when backpropagation and multi-layer networks started showing promise again.\n\n### **11. Did AI influence other fields during its early evolution?**\n\nAbsolutely. AI research heavily influenced robotics, linguistics, computer science, cognitive psychology, and philosophy. Many concepts, such as search algorithms and optimisation techniques, became foundational in computer science.\n\n### 12. **How did the early developments shape today’s AI?**\n\nThe early years laid the theoretical and ethical foundations. Despite limited hardware and data, pioneers developed core ideas—symbolic reasoning, learning from data, and human-computer interaction—that evolved into today’s neural networks, generative AI, and intelligent agents.\n\n[AI](https://www.verloop.io/tag/ai/)\n\nRelated Posts\n\n[b2b sales strategy](https://www.verloop.io/tag/b2b-sales-strategy/)\n\n###### [Your Greatest Sales Advisor: Conversational Automation](https://www.verloop.io/blog/your-greatest-sales-advisor-conversational-automation/)\n\n* [Harshitha Raj](https://www.verloop.io/author/harshitha/)\n\n[voice AI](https://www.verloop.io/tag/voice-ai/)\n\n###### [Voice AI Agents: What’s Working, What’s Not, What’s Next in 2025](https://www.verloop.io/blog/voice-ai-agents-in-2025/)\n\n* [Harshitha Raj](https://www.verloop.io/author/harshitha/)\n\n[Conversational AI](https://www.verloop.io/tag/conversational-ai/)\n\n###### [Conversational AI Chatbots: Good or Bad For Your Support Agents?](https://www.verloop.io/blog/conversational-ai-for-agents/)\n\n* [Harshitha Raj](https://www.verloop.io/author/harshitha/)\n\nSee how Verloop.io helps 200+ businesses scale their support.\n\n[Schedule a Demo](javascript:; \"Schedule a demo\")\n\n## Add Your Heading Text Here\n\n "

Over the decades, it evolved from basic rule-based systems to powerful models that generate text, art, music, and code. Today’s AI tools are part of everyday life, shaping how we search, learn, and create. As AI continues to grow, so do the questions about its ethics, limitations, and impact on society. This concise timeline highlights the key turning points in AI’s remarkable journey.\n\n### **Early Foundations**\n\n* **1950 – The Turing Test**  \n   Alan Turing proposed a test to determine whether a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence—a foundational question that continues to shape AI ethics and design.\n* **1956 – Birth of AI at Dartmouth**  \n   The Dartmouth Conference, led by John McCarthy and others, officially launched the field of Artificial Intelligence and coined the term “AI.”\n* **1956–1957 – Early AI Programs**  \n   Programs like *Logic Theorist* and *General Problem Solver* demonstrated that computers could mimic basic reasoning and problem-solving.\n* **1966 – ELIZA: The First Chatbot**  \n   Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA simulated a conversation with a therapist, revealing both the potential and limits of human-computer interaction.\n\n---\n\n### **Growth, Setbacks, and Learning**\n\n* **1970s–1980s – Expert Systems & AI Hype**  \n   Rule-based systems that mimicked decision-making were adopted in business and medicine. However, overpromises led to a loss of funding and trust—an era known as the “AI Winter.”\n* **1997 – Deep Blue Beats Kasparov**  \n   IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, proving AI could master strategic games once thought too complex for machines.\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Machine Learning Era**\n\n* **2006 – Deep Learning Resurgence**  \n   Advances in computing power and big data revived neural networks. The term \"deep learning\" gained popularity and kickstarted modern AI research.\n* **2011 – IBM Watson Wins *Jeopardy!***  \n   Watson triumphed over human champions, showcasing AI’s ability to understand language, facts, and wordplay—though real-world applications proved more challenging.\n* **2012 – Image Recognition Breakthrough (AlexNet)**  \n   A deep learning model dramatically improved performance in image classification, paving the way for AI in facial recognition, medical imaging, and more.\n* **2014 – Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  \n   GANs enabled the creation of synthetic but realistic images, forming the foundation for modern image-generating AI tools like DALL·E and Midjourney.\n\n---\n\n### **AI Becomes Everyday**\n\n* **2016 – AlphaGo Defeats Go Champion**  \n   DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in the ancient game of Go, surprising experts and demonstrating AI’s growing ability to handle intuition-based tasks.\n* **2018 – Google’s BERT Transforms Language Understanding**  \n   BERT improved search engines and translation tools by better understanding context, marking a leap in natural language processing.\n\n---\n\n### **The Generative AI Boom**\n\n* **2022 – ChatGPT Release**  \n   OpenAI launched ChatGPT to the public, making conversational AI accessible to everyday users. It quickly became a widely adopted productivity and creativity tool.\n* **2023 – Multimodal AI & GPT-4**  \n   Models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 2 introduced multimodal capabilities—understanding not just text but images, charts, and more.\n* **2024 – Open Source AI Surge**  \n   Community-driven models like LLaMA, Mistral, and Mixtral offered free, customizable alternatives to commercial tools, pushing AI accessibility even further.\n\n* [<< **Previous:** What is Generative AI?](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/AI/whatis)\n* [**Next:** AI Literacy >>](https://guides.lib.usf.edu/c.php?g=1315087&p=10311320)\n\n* Last Updated: Oct 2, 2025 11:57 AM\n* URL: https://guides.lib.usf.edu/AI\n* [Print Page](javascript: window.print();)\n\n[Login to LibApps](https://usf.libapps.com/libapps/login.php?site_id=1374&target64=L2xpYmd1aWRlcy9hZG1pbl9jLnBocD9nPTEzMTUwODcmcD0xMTA1NTk5MQ==)\n\n[Report a problem](https://lib.usf.edu/help/)\n\nSubjects: [1.
