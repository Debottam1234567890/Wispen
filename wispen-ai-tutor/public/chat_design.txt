Wispen Chat Interface: "The Learning Universe"
🌌 Core Concept: A Three-Realm Universe
Your chat interface isn't just a chat — it's a cosmic learning ecosystem with three interconnected realms:

📚 The Bookshelf Nebula (Source Hub)
🏭 The Creation Factory (AI Output Hub)
💬 The Chat Cosmos (Main Interaction Space)

All connected by an infinite SVG universe that feels alive, explorable, and magical.

🎨 Visual Universe Design (SVG-Based)
Background: Infinite Starfield

Deep gradient: Dark purple → Midnight blue → Black
Animated twinkling stars (varying sizes, opacity pulse)
Subtle nebula clouds (pink, blue, purple) drifting slowly
Parallax effect: Stars move at different speeds when scrolling/panning
Shooting stars occasionally streak across (every 10-15 seconds)

Three Floating Realms/Islands
Each realm is a glowing, floating platform in space:

                  |
    💬 CHAT COSMOS ←→ 🏭 CREATION FACTORY
      (Center/Main)        (Top Right)
Visual Style for Each Realm:

Translucent glass-morphism platforms
Glowing edges (realm-specific colors)
Soft particle effects around borders
Hover: Platform gently pulses/breathes
Click: Smooth zoom-in transition

🎨 Technical Considerations
SVG Universe:

Use <svg> with viewBox for infinite canvas
CSS animations for stars (staggered)
<g> groups for each realm (easy to move)
Paths for connecting lines
Filters for glow effects

Performance:

Lazy load book contents
Limit visible stars (cull off-screen)
Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
Canvas fallback for complex animations

Accessibility:

High contrast mode available
Keyboard navigation for all actions
Screen reader friendly labels
Reduce motion option (simpler animations)
