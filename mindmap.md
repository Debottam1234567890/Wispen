  *Comprehensive overview covering 10 sections*
  🏷️  Tags: Vertical and Horizontal Shifts, Reflections Across Axes, Even and Odd Functions, Vertical and Horizontal Stretches/Compressions

  📌 **Transformations of Functions: Shifts, Reflections, Stretches, Compressions**
    *This section explores how to modify function graphs through shifts, reflections, stretches, and compressions.  Understanding these transformations allows us to model real-world phenomena effectively and manipulate functions to fit specific needs.*
    💡 Examples:
      - Shifting a parabola up by 2 units
      - Reflecting a sine wave across the x-axis
    🏷️  Tags: function transformations, graphing, precalculus, algebra

    🔹 **Vertical and Horizontal Shifts of Functions**
      *Functions can be translated vertically or horizontally by adding or subtracting constants to the output or input, respectively. These shifts alter the graph's position without changing its shape.*
      💡 Examples:
        - f(x) + 2 shifts the graph of f(x) up by 2
        - f(x - 3) shifts the graph of f(x) right by 3
      🏷️  Tags: shifts, translations, graphing, transformations

      ▫️ **Vertical Shifts: Adding to the Output**
        *Adding a constant 'k' to a function, f(x) + k, shifts the entire graph vertically.  Positive 'k' moves the graph up, while negative 'k' moves it down. This affects the range.*
        💡 Examples:
          - f(x) = x^2 + 5 shifts the standard parabola up 5 units
          - If f(x) has a max at (2,4), f(x)+3 has a max at (2,7)
        🏷️  Tags: vertical shift, output change, translation, range

        ▫️ **Positive Vertical Shift**
          *Adding a positive constant 'k' to f(x) moves the graph upward by 'k' units. All y-values increase, affecting the range.*
          💡 Examples:
            - f(x) = |x| + 1
            - The graph of f(x) = sin(x) + 2 is sin(x) shifted up 2 units.
          🏷️  Tags: positive k, upward shift, range increase

        ▫️ **Negative Vertical Shift**
          *Adding a negative constant (subtracting 'k') from f(x) moves the graph downward by 'k' units. All y-values decrease, affecting the range.*
          💡 Examples:
            - f(x) = x^3 - 4
            - The graph of f(x) = cos(x) - 1 is cos(x) shifted down 1 unit.
          🏷️  Tags: negative k, downward shift, range decrease

      ▫️ **Horizontal Shifts: Adding to the Input**
        *Adding a constant 'h' inside the function, f(x + h), shifts the graph horizontally. Positive 'h' shifts left, negative 'h' shifts right, impacting the domain.*
        💡 Examples:
          - f(x) = (x - 2)^2 shifts the standard parabola right 2 units
          - If f(x) has a zero at (1,0), f(x-4) has a zero at (5,0)
        🏷️  Tags: horizontal shift, input change, domain, translations

        ▫️ **Positive Horizontal Shift**
          *Adding a positive constant 'h' to 'x' inside f(x) shifts the graph left by 'h' units.  The x-values decrease.*
          💡 Examples:
            - f(x) = sqrt(x+1) shifts the square root graph left 1 unit.
            - f(x)=(x+5)^2 shifts the parabola left 5 units
          🏷️  Tags: positive h, leftward shift, domain decrease

        ▫️ **Negative Horizontal Shift**
          *Subtracting a constant 'h' from 'x' inside f(x) shifts the graph right by 'h' units. The x-values increase.*
          💡 Examples:
            - f(x) = 1/(x-2) shifts the reciprocal graph right 2 units.
            - f(x)=|x-3| shifts the absolute value graph right 3 units
          🏷️  Tags: negative h, rightward shift, domain increase

      ▫️ **Combined Vertical and Horizontal Shifts**
        *Combining both shifts results in f(x + h) + k, where 'h' is the horizontal shift and 'k' is the vertical shift.  Order doesn't matter.*
        💡 Examples:
          - f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 3: right 1, up 3

        🏷️  Tags: even function, odd function, symmetry, y-axis

    🔹 **Stretches and Compressions of Functions**
      *These transformations alter the shape of the graph by either stretching it away from or compressing it toward an axis.  They involve multiplying the function or its argument by a constant.*
      💡 Examples:
        - 2*f(x) vertically stretches the graph of f(x)
        - f(0.5*x) horizontally stretches the graph of f(x)
      🏷️  Tags: stretches, compressions, scaling, graph transformations

      ▫️ **Vertical Stretches and Compressions**
        *Multiplying the function by a constant 'a', a*f(x), vertically stretches (a > 1) or compresses (0 < a < 1) the graph.*
        💡 Examples:
          - 2x^2: Vertical stretch of x^2 by factor 2
          - 0.5|x|: Vertical compression of |x| by factor 0.5

      ▫️ **Relations and Functions**
        *Distinguishing between relations (sets of ordered pairs) and functions (relations with unique outputs for each input).*
        💡 Examples:
          - {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)} is a function
          - {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)} is not a function
        🏷️  Tags: relation, function, ordered pairs, unique output

      ▫️ **Domain and Range**
        *Identifying the set of all possible input values (domain) and the set of all possible output values (range) for a function.*
        💡 Examples:
          - The domain of √x is [0, ∞)
          - The range of x² is [0, ∞)
        🏷️  Tags: input, output, restrictions, intervals

      ▫️ **Vertical Line Test**
        *Using the vertical line test to determine if a graph represents a function by checking if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once.*
        💡 Examples:
          - If a vertical line intersects the graph once, it is a function
          - If a vertical line intersects the graph multiple times, it is not a function
